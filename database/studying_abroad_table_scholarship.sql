It is the science of the very small - working on a scale of nanometres, a millionth of a millimetre. The capacity to manipulate matter at the level of nanometres offers enormous potential to revolutionize our lives by transforming areas such as energy production, manufacturing, communication technology, electronics and more.\r\n\r\nSpecific examples that indicate the breadth of nanotechnology applications include:\r\n\r\n    Semiconductors where it is hoped that very small components will continue the increase in computational speed predicted by Moore\'s Law.\r\n    Chemical systems that expect nanotechnology to provide sophisticated sensors for chemicals at low concentrations with applications to biological systems.\r\n    Biology, where biologists seek means of manipulating and sensing biological processes within cells.\r\n\r\nWhere can Nanotechnology take me?\r\n\r\nNew products and processes are developed where physics, chemistry, biology and engineering meet. Nanotechnology applications include computer technology, healthcare, sustainability and helping to make vehicles and machines faster, lighter and stronger.\r\n\r\nYou can find work in roles such as physicist, chemist, space physicist or research scientist.\r\n\r\nOur graduates have been placed and employed in businesses such as SGS, Rio Tinto, Dulux, Starpharma, Air Services Australia, Crocodile Gold Corp., Australian Radiation Services, CETEC-Foray and the Australian Academy of Technological Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nFurther study options\r\n\r\nYou conduct research into specific topic within Nanotechnology by studying a one-year Bachelor of Sciences with Honours in Nanotechnology.

The MBA provides knowledge and skills that are essential for superior management performance.\r\n\r\nThe course provides unparallel program flexibility. Students design their MBA to match their employment aspirations. A wide range of specialist skills is also introduced through a choice of majors and sub-majors. The teaching staff are drawn from among the finest researchers and university educators around the world, keeping students abreast of current trends and focusing on the global picture.\r\n\r\nCourse objectives\r\n\r\n    General management skills develop expertise in strategic thinking, critical analysis, developing and implementing business plans, decision-making under uncertainty, understanding organizational dynamics, motivating others, effective communication, leadership, and promoting change in dynamic environments.\r\n    Functional skills develop competency in a number of key disciplines including accounting, finance, marketing and human resources management.\r\n\r\nIn a world where innovation is a key to success, leaders are called to the fore to manage people and projects. The Technology Management major is designed for students who have a technical background or a keen interest in technology and therefore a strong alignment with analytical approaches. From this platform the objectives are underpinned by the desire to expose students to a broader body of knowledge and range of approaches than experienced in a purely technical framework.\r\n\r\nA key issue is the benefit that accrues from complementary analytical and mathemattical modeling approaches with business and social science skills. Much of the value and strength of the Technology Management major relate to consideration of approaches and perceptions that are extensions of, or build upon, an engineering / scientific view point. The differences between technocratic approaches and human and societal constructs are brought into sharp focus broadening the perspectives of students.\r\n\r\nThe major is specifically designed to enhance understanding of the need for technology, people and society to be viewed as closely interrelated aspects of all engineering and business activity.\r\n\r\nCareers\r\n\r\nThe MBA is a widely recognized and transportable postgraduate degree.

The program thus places emphasis on the mastery of fundamental principles and application of the latest engineering technology. Of equal importance is the training of leadership, entrepreneurship, and communication skills.\r\n\r\nWe encourage life-long learning so that graduates can keep abreast of new developments in engineering and technology.\r\n\r\nProgram Characteristics:\r\n\r\nThis program is a major electrical engineering degree program in Hong Kong, and provides unique and up-to-date education in the interesting field of electrical power and energy.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum is designed to give a balanced treatment of university core requirement, electrical engineering fundamentals, advanced and specialist subjects, and non-technical subjects such as economics and management.\r\n\r\nEngineering practice is an integrated component of the curriculum. Student learning is supplemented by a variety of laboratory, training and project activities. Students also develop good presentation and problem-solving skills through mini-projects and final-year projects. Students are required to take the Work-Integrated Education (WIE) component, which may be in the form of summer training or industrial attachment.\r\n\r\nProgram Structure\r\n\r\n    Students complete a first year of fundamental studies in common with students within the Engineering Broad Discipline. The Year One curriculum focuses on the underpinning subjects (such as Physics and Mathematics), languages, information technology, and General Education studies.\r\n    The Year Two curriculum focuses on the fundamentals of engineering science, engineering mathematics, computing, and introductory studies of electrical engineering.\r\n    In Year Three, students follow a semi-structured study pattern by taking compulsory core subjects in electrical engineering and Elective Subjects. The focus is on consolidating the fundamentals, team work and experimental methods. Beside, discipline-specific language subjects are studied.\r\n    Students take the advanced Core Subjects and Elective Subjects together with their Final Year Projects. Final Year Projects provide a comprehensive learning experience in engineering technology, problem-solving techniques, communication skills (both written and verbal) and creative thinking.\r\n\r\nCareer Prospects\r\n\r\nOur graduates have numerous employment opportunities in engineering planning and design, manufacturing, installation, maintenance and servicing, engineering sales and research.\r\n\r\nGraduates are able to develop rewarding professionals in major utility and transportation companies such as CLP Power Hong Kong Limited, the Hong kong Electric Company and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation.
