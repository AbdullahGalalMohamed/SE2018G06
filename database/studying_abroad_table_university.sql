Even to the present day, it is still the only state university dedicated to technology. Numerous excellent TUM professors have secured their place in the history of technology, many important scientists, architects, engineers and entrepreneurs studied there. Such names as Karl Max von Bauernfeind, Rudolf Diesel, Claude Dornier, Walther von Dyck, Hans Fischer (Nobel prize for Chemistry 1930), Ernst Otto Fischer (Nobel prize for Chemistry 1973), August Föppl, Robert Huber (Nobel prize for Chemistry 1988), Carl von Linde, Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, Walther Meissner, Rudolf Mössbauer (1961 Nobel prize for Physics), Willy Messerschmitt (aircraft designer), Wilhelm Nusselt, Hans Piloty, Friedrich von Thiersch, Franz von Soxhlet are closely connected with the TUM.\r\n\r\nThe prerequisites for an academic training in engineering were created at the start of the 19th century when the advancement of technology on the basis of exact sciences commenced. There were also calls for a \'university for all technical studies\' in Bavaria. The \'polytechnic schools\' set up in Augsburg, Munich and Nuremberg, which bridged the gap between middle schools and higher education colleges in their capacity as \'lyceums\' (or high schools), were the first approach. For further qualification purposes, a \'technical college\' was set up in 1833 as part of the Faculty of State Finance (Staatswirtschaftlichen Fakultät) of the Ludwig Maximilian University, which had been transferred from Landshut to Munich seven years previously. The experiment failed. Instead, an advanced \'engineering course\' was established at the Polytechnic School Munich in 1840, which was the forerunner of what was later to become the \'Technische Hochschule München\'.\r\nFoundation of \"Polytechnische Schule München\"\r\nThe old Technical University of Munich building.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, King Ludwig II founded the newly structured Polytechnische Schule München, which had the status of a university, in Munich. It was allowed to call itself Königlich Bayerische Technische Hochschule München as from the academic year 1877–78. The first Principal was the former Head of the Engineering Course, Karl Max von Bauernfeind. In the year of its foundation, the college took up residence in the new building in Arcisstrasse, which was designed by Gottfried v. Neureuther. In those days, more than 350 students were taught by 24 professors and 21 lecturers. The college was divided into five sections: I. General Department (Mathematics, Natural Science, Humanities, Law and Economics), II. Engineering Department (Structural Engineering and Surveying), III. Department of Architecture, IV. Mechanical/Technical Department, V. Chemical/Technical Department. Department VI. (Agriculture) was added in 1872.\r\n\r\nTwo of the university\'s long-standing requests were met by the state after the beginning of the 20th century: it was granted the right to award doctorates in 1901, and in 1902 the election of the principal by the teaching staff was approved. With an average of about 2,600 to 2,800 students, the TH München ranked ahead of the TH Berlin as the largest German technical college for a while. The first female undergraduate matriculated in architecture in 1905, after the Bavarian government officially allowed women to study at a technical college in the German Reich. However, the proportion of female students remained negligible; women accounted for just 0.6 per cent of the student body in the winter semester of 1913–14.\r\n\r\nDuring the Weimar Republic, the TH München was obliged to make do with low funds and was drawn into radical political struggles in 1918–19 and again between 1928 and 1933. In the winter term of 1930–31, the National Socialist German Student Union (NSDStB) became the strongest group within the AStA general student organisation of the THM for the first time.\r\nBroadening the spectrum of subjects\r\n\r\nThe TH München was able to broaden its spectrum of subjects by taking over several smaller colleges that were no longer viable. In 1922, the former commercial college \'Handelshochschule München\' became the VII Department of Economics. The former College of Agriculture and Brewing in Weihenstephan was integrated in 1930. Its agricultural unit was absorbed into the Department of Agriculture – which was located in Munich until 1947 before transferring to Weihenstephan, while the brewing section became Department VIII \'Brewing Technology\' belonging to the TH München yet located in Weihenstephan. The tradition of the Weihenstephan campus dates back to the agricultural school founded in 1804, which was elevated to the status of an academy in 1895 and a university in 1920.\r\n\r\nThe eight departments of the TH München were reorganised into six faculties in 1934. This was reduced to five (General Sciences, Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Agriculture, Brewing) in 1940.\r\n\r\nDuring the Third Reich, the \'leadership principle\' was imposed on the TH München. Its autonomy suffered considerable restrictions which affected such matters as the appointment procedure (for lecturers), etc. Based on the newly introduced \'Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\', lecturers of non-Aryan descent or those who were married to \'non-Aryans\' were removed by the State, likewise politically \'undesirable\' professors. The National Socialist German Students\' League (NSDStB) and the like-minded German Student Union (Deutsche Studentenschaft) endeavoured to organise and influence the undergraduates with their radical national socialist doctrine.\r\n\r\nSimilar organisations were in place on the lecturers\' level. Jewish students no longer enjoyed the same rights and were barred from matriculation from 1938 onwards. The TH München was required to contribute towards the Second World War effort with large-scale armament research. However, top-level basic research was still conducted in numerous institutes. The attitude of the university professors was characterised by opportunistic conformance on the one hand, and critical distancing and inner emigration[further explanation needed] on the other. A number of individual professors, employees, workers and students dared to demonstrate disobedience and obstruction.\r\n\r\nIt was under the hardest possible conditions that teaching activities recommenced in April 1946. 80% of the buildings on the main campus had been bombed. For many years, undergraduates actively supported the rebuilding of their university by providing hands-on (voluntary) restoration service. The Department of Economics had to be surrendered to the Ludwig Maximilian University in 1946.\r\n\"Research Reactor Munich\" (FRM) third location\r\n\r\nWith the internationally acclaimed installation of the Research Reactor Munich (FRM) in Garching in 1956/57, the TH München gained a third location. The Physics Department building was opened there in 1969, followed by the new building for housing the departments of Chemistry, Biology and Geoscience in 1977.\r\n\r\nIn December 1957, the university was granted its long-standing request to acquire the status of a \'public legal body\'. In the following year, the first constitution drawn up by the university itself came into force. From the 1960s onwards, the university had to cope with an enormous influx of students. When the first economising measures were introduced by the State in the mid-Seventies, the conditions for students began to deteriorate.\r\n\r\nA Faculty for Medicine spanning two sites: Munich-Haidhausen (Clinic \'right of the Isar\') and Munich-Schwabing (Biederstein, Children\'s Clinic at Schwabing Hospital) was founded in 1967.\r\n100th anniversary\r\n\r\nThe university\'s 100th anniversary fell in the \'hot May\' of 1968. Critical tendencies were also in evidence at the TH München, particularly in the Departments of Architecture, Geography, Medicine and Social Sciences. In the 100th year since its foundation, the TH München comprised six faculties, 168 chairs and institutes, about 8,400 undergraduates and somewhere in the region of 5,700 university staff, who were employed in teaching, research, running operations and administration. In 1972, a sports centre with a \'central sports ground\' covering an area of 45 hectares, that had previously been used for the Olympic Games was set up in the grounds of the Olympic stadion.\r\n\r\nThe new designation of \'Technische Universität München\' was conferred in August 1970. With the introduction of the Bavarian Higher Education Law in 1974, the six faculties were replaced by eleven smaller departments, which soon resumed the designation of Faculties: 1. Mathematics and Informatics, 2. Physics, 3. Chemistry, Biology and Geoscience, 4. Economics and Social Sciences, 5. Structural Engineering and Surveying, 6. Architecture, 7. Mechanical Engineering, 8. Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, 9. Agriculture and Horticulture, 10. Brewing, Food Technology and Dairy Science, 11. Medicine. In addition, several interdisciplinary central institutes were established, initially for regional planning and environmental research, as well as sports sciences. The \'regulated student organisation\' was abolished in Bavaria and replaced by structures of student involvement within the context of the newly introduced group representation concept.\r\nTwelve faculties at three locations\r\nTechnical University of Munich at Garching, Department of Mechanical Engineering\r\n\r\nIn 1992, a twelfth faculty \'Informatics\' was created by splitting the former Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics into two. Ten years later a Faculty of Sports Science and a Faculty of Economics were set up. The latter incorporated the former \'Faculty of Economics and Social Science. The Mechanical Engineering Faculty and the Faculties of Mathematics and Informatics moved from the main Munich campus to the new buildings in Garching in 1997 and 2002 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Weihenstephan campus was restructured for the start of the winter semester 2000/01 and realigned along scientific lines: the former Faculties of Agriculture and Horticulture, Brewing, Food Technology and Dairy Science, as well as the Forestry Faculty that previously belonged to the Ludwig Maximilian University, were collectively accommodated in the newly established Weihenstephan Science Centre for Life&Food Sciences, Land Use and Environment (WZW).\r\nAn \"entrepreneurial university\"\r\n\r\nNumerous other reform procedures have been realised since 1995 under the auspices of TUM\'s president, Wolfgang A. Herrmann, such as the introduction of efficient guidance and decision profiles, the resolute expansion of the university\'s autonomy in keeping with the new philosophy of an \'entrepreneurial university\', university-wide core competences in the field of informatics, the establishment of central institutes and research platforms with an interdisciplinary focus, the introduction of numerous, attractive Bachelor/Master\'s degree courses, strategic internationalisation, enhanced collaboration with industrial and social partners, stepping up professional fundraising, the inauguration of the Carl-von-Linde Academy to house the Humanities, Cultural and Social Studies.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, the TUM initiated the setting-up of the very first subsidiary of a German university abroad with its \'German Institute of Science and Technology\' (GIST) in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe commissioning of the new \'Heinz Maier-Leibniz Research Reactor Munich\' (FRM-II) in 2004 heralded in a new era of neutron research with lots of promising applications in the fields of science, technology and medicine. The high-flux Neutron Source has served to place the TUM among the world\'s leaders in terms of scientific and technical research.\r\n\r\nBy the summer semester 2010, the TUM comprised thirteen faculties with more than 26,000 students (about 20 per cent of whom came from abroad), about 460 professors of both sexes and roughly 8,500 members of staff. In 2013, the university has 32.547 students (18% international), 507 professors (16% female), and 9,704 members of staff.\r\nCampuses\r\nmain campus (only small dark brown building area) aerial view in Munich downtown\r\n\r\nTUM’s academic faculties are divided amongst three campuses in the greater Munich area. The Main Campus in central Munich houses the faculties of Architecture, Medicine, Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Civil Engineering, Surveying, Economics, Social and Sports Sciences. A second large campus is located in Garching, about 10 km north of Munich. Garching is home to the faculties of Physics, Chemistry, Informatics, Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering, as well as the Garching research reactor. Over the years, several research institutes, including the Max-Planck Society, the Bavarian Academy of Science and the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität of Munich have joined TUM in Garching. The third TUM campus is located 35 km north of Munich in Weihenstephan, Freising, and is home to the faculties of Biology, Agricultural Science and Horticulture, Forestry and Resource Management, Brewing and Food Technology, Nutrition, and Landscape Planning and Landscape Architecture. There are also many institutions throughout Munich and the surrounding area that belong to TUM. These include the hospital Rechts der Isar, used for training medical students, and the Central University Athletic Complex.\r\n\r\nThe TUM, like many German universities, is a “non campus” university. However, with further expansion plans for the Garching site, more and more departments are to be placed into new buildings in Garching. The Garching campus, unlike the downtown area, is set up more like a traditional “quadrangle” style campus with a large grouping of buildings. At the moment, university buildings are spread over four main and several minor locations:\r\nMunich\r\n\r\n    TUM Department of Architecture (Main Campus)\r\n    TUM Department of Civil, Geo and Environmental Engineering ( Main Campus )\r\n    TUM Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (Main Campus)\r\n    TUM School of Management (Main Campus)\r\n    TUM School of Medicine (Klinikum rechts der Isar)\r\n    TUM Department of Sport and Health Sciences, Olympic Park (Munich)\r\n    TUM School of Education (since 1 October 2009, Munich)\r\n\r\nGarching\r\n\r\n    TUM Department of Chemistry\r\n    TUM Department of Informatics\r\n    TUM Department of Mechanical Engineering\r\n    TUM Department of Mathematics\r\n    TUM Department of Physics\r\n\r\nWeihenstephan (Freising)\r\n\r\n    TUM School of Life Sciences Weihenstephan\r\n\r\nStraubing\r\n\r\n    Science Centre Straubing\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n    TUM operates a subsidiary in Singapore. In 2001, TUM founded the German Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) – TUM Asia with its partner universities: the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, offering a range of Master of Science degree programmes. In 2010, GIST – TUM Asia collaborated with the Singapore Institute of Technology to offer bachelor\'s degrees. Today, GIST – TUM Asia is recognized in Singapore as an independent subsidiary of TUM and offers not only higher education options, but also caters executive education and training for managers and professionals. GIST – TUM Asia acts as a contact point for students and young professionals throughout Asia and the rest of the world, facilitating an environment for an individual to receive an international education.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, GIST – TUM Asia also helped to set up TUM Create, a research center that engages the top minds from Germany and Asia. TUM Create is currently focusing on the project on Electric Mobility Solutions for Megacities (2010) at the CREATE Research Campus of the Singapore National Research Foundation.\r\nOrganization\r\nWerner-von-Siemens Auditorium Maximum at main campus in downtown Munich.\r\nExtended Board of Management\r\n\r\nThe Extended Board of Management advises the Executive Board of Management and assists in discharging its duties. Alongside the Chief Executives (President, Chancellor, Vice Presidents), it consists of the Department Deans, the Speaker for the Central Scientific Institutions and the Speaker for the Deans of Studies.\r\nSupervisory Board\r\n\r\nThe TUM Supervisory Board is the TUM\'s monitoring body and steering committee, comprising the members of the Senate and the External University Council. The External University Council comprises eight high-ranking representatives from the fields of science, culture, industry and politics. Current members include:\r\n\r\n    Susanne Klatten, Member of the Supervisory Board, Altana, BMW AG\r\n\r\nFaculty\r\n\r\nTUM has 528 professors, 9,846 staff members.[3]\r\nStudents\r\n\r\nAs of winter semester 2015 TUM has 39,081[3] students in undergraduate and graduate programs, of whom c. 8,600 are foreign students. Student initiatives include the IKOM, a career fair, the TUM Speakers Series, a series of speeches which is organised by students, and open-air-festivals TUNIX and GARNIX.\r\nTUM Graduate School\r\n\r\nThe TUM Graduate School was founded in May 2009. The goal of this institution is to facilitate all doctorates with further specialist and transferable skills as well as to encourage the building of international and interdisciplinary networks. The TUM Graduate School officiates as the parent organization of the TUM’s Faculty Graduate Centers (FGCs) and Thematic Graduate Centers (TGCs), encompassing over 3000 doctorates. Currently 8 FGCs and TGCs officially exist with a further 13 graduate centers in formation. The TUM Graduate School is presided over by the Graduate Dean. The Founding Dean is Professor Ernst Rank, who is also the director of the International School of Science and Engineering (IGSSE). The TUM Graduate School’s doctorates are supervised by a manager and an administration team.\r\nResearch\r\n\r\nThe Technical University of Munich is one of the most research-focused universities in Germany and Europe. This claim is supported by relevant rankings, such as the DFG-Förderranking (DFG Funding Rankings) or the research rankings of the Centrum für Hochschulentwicklung (CHE – Center for Higher Education Development). TUM was one of three universities which were successful in obtaining funding in all three funding lines of the Excellence Initiative in 2006. Along with the International Graduate School of Science and Engineering (IGSSE) and TUM’s participation in five Clusters of Excellence, the strategic plan \"TUM. The Entrepreneurial University\" was funded. The current round of the Excellence Initiative (funding period 2012–2017) confirmed TUM\'s strategic concept, the graduate school IGSSE, the clusters of excellence Origin and Structure of the Universe, Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics, Nanosystems Initiative Munich, Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich and approved the new cluster Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology. In addition, TUM takes part in more than 20 Collaborative Research Centres, of which TUM is the spokesperson in nine. In the seventh European Union Research Framework Program, TUM coordinates thus far nine projects and also received six Starting Independent Researcher Grants and five Advanced Investigator Grants.\r\n\r\nTUM features a strong, characteristic profile in the fields of Science and Engineering. Alongside the traditional key areas addressed by technical universities, powerful links have been also established with the life sciences, ranging from nutrition and food sciences, biotechnology and bioinformatics to medicine. Much of its innovative research and teaching has emerged from collaborations between the disciplines.\r\n\r\nThrough close collaboration with business and industry, TUM provided important contributions to Bavaria\'s development from an agricultural land to a center of high-level technology. Even today, successful research collaborations with companies – among them Siemens, BMW, and Audi – contribute to expediting the transfer of knowledge and technology into the economy. More than 30 percent of TUM’s third party funding stems from third party sources such as these. Approximately 600 new research collaborations occur annually.\r\nResearch centres\r\n\r\n    TUM Institute for Advanced Study\r\n    Research Neutron Source \"Heinz Maier-Leibnitz\" (FRM II)\r\n    Walter Schottky Institute for Semiconductor Research (WSI)\r\n    Leonardo da Vinci-Zentrum für Bionik\r\n    TUM Institute for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (nanoTUM)\r\n    Straubing Center of Science\r\n    Corporate Research Center of Food and Nutrition Science (ZIEL)\r\n    Corporate Research Center of Biomedical Engineering (IMETUM)\r\n    Catalysis Research Center\r\n    Munich Center of Molecular Life Sciences\r\n    TUM School of Governance\r\n\r\nPartnerships\r\n\r\nTUM\'s first spin-off is the German Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) – TUM Asia, located in Singapore (together with National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Institute of Technology).\r\n\r\nTUM has currently over 175 international partnerships, among them:\r\n\r\n    Europe: ETH Zurich, EPFL, ENSEA, École Centrale Paris, TU Eindhoven, Technical University of Denmark, Technical University of Vienna\r\n    United States of America: MIT, Stanford University, University of Illinois, Cornell University, University of Texas at Austin, Georgia Tech\r\n    Asia: National University of Singapore, Amrita University, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, University of Tokyo, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology,\r\n    Australia: University of Melbourne, RMIT University, and many others.\r\n\r\nTUM is also a partner of LAOTSE, an international network for student and senior lecturers among leading European and Asian universities, as well as a member of the TIME network (Top Industrial Managers for Europe).\r\nScholarships\r\n\r\nSince TUM is a research university, it offers several scholarship programs to students such as:[7]\r\n\r\n    Alfred Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Stiftung\r\n    Bayerisch-Französisches Hochschulzentrum\r\n    Bayrische Amerika-Akademie\r\n    The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)\r\n    and more'),
(3, 16, 'RWTH Aachen University', 'RWTH Aachen University (German: [???ve?te??ha? ??a?xn?]) or Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen[Note 1] is a research university located in Aachen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. With more than 42,000 students enrolled in 144 study programs, it is the largest technical university in Germany.[3][4]\r\n\r\nThe university maintains close links to industry (one in five board members of German corporate groups has studied in Aachen)[5] and accounts for the highest amount of third-party funds of all German universities in both absolute and relative terms per faculty member.[6] In 2007, RWTH Aachen was chosen by the DFG as one of nine German Universities of Excellence for its future concept RWTH 2020: Meeting Global Challenges and additionally won funding for one graduate school and three clusters of excellence.[7] RWTH Aachen is a founding member of IDEA League,[8] a strategic alliance of four leading universities of technology in Europe. The university is also a member of TU9,[9] DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)[10] and the Top Industrial Managers for Europe[11] network. \r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nOn 25 January 1858, prince Frederick William of Prussia (later German emperor), was given a donation of 5,000 talers from the Aachener und Münchener Feuer-Versicherungs-Gesellschaft, the precursor of the AachenMünchener insurance company, for charity. In March, the prince chose to use the donation to found the first Prussian institute of technology somewhere in the Rhine province. The seat of the institution remained undecided over years; while the prince initially favored Koblenz, the cities of Aachen, Bonn, Cologne and Düsseldorf also applied, with Aachen and Cologne being the main competitors. Aachen finally won with a financing concept backed by the insurance company and by local banks.[12] Groundbreaking for the new Polytechnikum took place on 15 May 1865 and lectures started during the Franco-Prussian War on 10 October 1870 with 223 students and 32 teachers. The new institution had as its primary purpose the education of engineers, especially for the mining industry in the Ruhr area; there were schools of chemistry, electrical and mechanical engineering as well as an introductory general school that taught mathematics and natural sciences and some social sciences.\r\nMain Building of the RWTH Aachen. It was built in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe unclear position of the new Prussian polytechnika (which officially were not universities) affected the first years. Polytechnics lacked prestige in society and the number of students decreased. This began to change in 1880 when the early RWTH, amongst others, was reorganized as a Royal Technical University, gained a seat in the Prussian House of Lords and finally won the right to bestow Dr.-Ing. (1899) degrees and Dipl.-Ing. titles (introduced in 1902). In the same year, over 800 male students enrolled. In 1909 the first women were admitted and the artist August von Brandis succeeded Alexander Frenz at the Faculty of Architecture as a \"professor of figure and landscape painting\", Brandis became dean in 1929.[13]\r\n\r\nWorld War I, however, proved a serious setback for the university. Many students voluntarily joined up and died in the war, and parts of the university were shortly occupied or confiscated.\r\n\r\nWhile the (then no more royal) TH Aachen (Technische Hochschule Aachen) flourished in the 1920s with the introduction of more independent faculties, of several new institutes and of the general students\' committee, the first signs of nationalist radicalization also became visible within the university. The Third Reich\'s Gleichschaltung of the TH in 1933 met with relatively low resistance from both students and faculty. Beginning in September 1933, Jewish and (alleged) Communist professors (and from 1937 on also students) were systematically persecuted and excluded from the university. Vacant Chairs were increasingly given to NSDAP party-members or sympathizers.[14] The freedom of research and teaching became severely limited, and institutes important for the regime\'s plans were systematically established,[by whom?] and existing chairs promoted. Briefly closed in 1939, the TH continued courses in 1940, although with a low number of students. On 21 October 1944, when Aachen capitulated, more than 70% of all buildings of the university were destroyed or heavily damaged.\r\n\r\nAfter World War II ended in 1945 the university recovered and expanded quickly. In the 1950s, many professors who had been removed because of their alleged affiliation with the Nazi party were allowed to return and a multitude of new institutes were founded. By the late 1960s, the TH had 10,000 students, making it the foremost of all German technical universities. With the foundation of philosophical and medical faculties in 1965 and 1966, respectively, the university became more \"universal\". The newly founded faculties in particular began attracting new students, and the number of students almost doubled twice from 1970 (10,000) to 1980 (more than 25,000) and from 1980 to 1990 (more than 37,000).[15] Now, the average number of students is around 42,000, with about one third of all students being women. By relative terms, the most popular study-programs are engineering (57%), natural science (23%), economics and humanities (13%) and medicine (7%).[15]\r\nRecent developments\r\n\"Red lecture hall\" at the central campus\r\n\r\nIn December 2006, RWTH Aachen and the Sultanate of Oman signed an agreement to establish a private German University of Technology in Muscat. Professors from Aachen aided in developing the curricula for the currently five study-programs and scientific staff took over some of the first courses.[16]\r\n\r\nIn 2007, RWTH Aachen was chosen as one of nine German Universities of Excellence for its future concept RWTH 2020: Meeting Global Challenges, earning it the connotation of being an elite university. However, although the list of universities honored for their future concepts mostly consists of large and already respected institutions, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research claimed that the initiative aimed at promoting universities with a dedicated future concept so they could continue researching on an international level.[17] Having won funds in all three lines of funding, the process brought RWTH Aachen University an additional total funding of € 180 million from 2007–2011. The other two lines of funding were graduate schools, where the Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science received funding and so-called \"clusters of excellence\", where RWTH Aachen managed to win funding for the three clusters: Ultra High-Speed Mobile Information and Communication (UMIC), Integrative Production Technology for High-wage Countries and Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass (TMFB).[18]\r\nView towards the city of Aachen from SuperC, a central building for students next to the main building at the midtown campus\r\nCampus\r\nThe newly built CARL in 2017, RWTH Aachen\r\n\r\nRWTH Aachen University\'s 620 acres (2.5 km2) campus is located in the north-western part of the city Aachen. There are two core areas – midtown and Melaten district. The Main Building, SuperC student\'s center and the Kármán Hall are 500 m away from the city centre with the Aachen Cathedral, the Audimax (biggest lecture hall) and the main refectory are 200 m farther. Other points of interest include the university\'s botanical garden (Botanischer Garten Aachen).\r\n\r\nA new building, the so-called Central Auditorium for Research and Learning (CARL) was opened in 2017. It offers space for 4000 students and replaces Audimax as the largest lecture hall building. The name of the new central auditorium, which is going to contain different lecture halls, is a reference to Charlemagne, who reigned his empire from Aachen in the middle-age.[19][20]\r\n\r\nThe RWTH has external facilities in Jülich and Essen and owns, together with the University of Stuttgart, a house in Kleinwalsertal in the Austrian Alps.\r\n\r\nThe university is currently expanding in the city center and Melaten district. The SuperC, the new central service building for students, was opened in 2008. The groundbreaking for the new Campus-Melaten was in 2009.\r\nInternationality\r\n\r\nDouble degrees and student mobility are promoted with other technology universities through the TIME (Top Industrial Managers for Europe) network. Furthermore, the RWTH is member of the IDEA League, which is a strategic partnership among four of Europe\'s leading research universities, including TU Delft, Chalmers University of Technology, and ETH Zürich, and was the first German university starting an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program in 2008.\r\n\r\nCompared to other German universities the RWTH Aachen received the highest amount of funds granted by third-party donors in the last years.[21]\r\n\r\nMore than 7,000 international students are currently enrolled within the undergraduate, graduate or PhD programme. Compared to other German universities the portion of international students at the RWTH Aachen is higher-than-average.[15] The proximity of Aachen to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg combined with the subsequent exposure to a variety of cultural heritages has placed RWTH Aachen University in a unique position with regards to the reflection and promotion of international aspects and intensive interaction with other universities.\r\nRankings\r\nUniversity rankings\r\nGlobal\r\nARWU World[22] 	=201-300\r\nTHE World[24] 	=79\r\nQS World[23] 	=141\r\n\r\nNational rankings regularly identify RWTH Aachen as the best university in Germany in the fields of engineering (especially mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and electrical engineering), as well as amongst the top three in computer science, physics, chemistry, and medicine.[25][26][27][28][29] The 2015 QS World University Rankings ranked the university 12th in the world in mechanical engineering (by subject) and 53rd in engineering and technology (by faculty).[30][31]\r\n\r\nOn the national level, two prominent German newspapers, “Handelsblatt“ and “Wirtschaftswoche“, currently rank RWTH Aachen the first place in Germany in the fields of mechanical engineering (including chemical engineering), electrical engineering, industrial engineering, and computer science.[32] In the latest ranking published by DAAD together with Centre for Higher Education Development and Die Zeit, RWTH Aachen also stands on top among other German universities in the aforementioned fields of engineering and computer science.[33]\r\n\r\nInternationally, in the 2016 QS Faculty Rankings RWTH Aachen is placed 20 (Mechanical Engineering), 51-100 (Electrical Engineering), =40 (Physics & Astronomy), 36 (Chemical Engineering), 21 (Materials Science), =42 (Chemistry), =26 (Mineral and Mining Engineering.[34] In the 2016 The Times Higher Education Subject Rankings; 29 (Engineering and Technology), 49 (Physical Sciences), 29 (Computer Science).[35]\r\nOrganisation\r\nAmbox current red.svg\r\n	\r\nThe factual accuracy of parts of this article (those related to paragraph) may be compromised due to out-of-date information.

Since the summer semester of 2004 the state of North Rhine-Westphalia allowed universities to request a maximum of €500 per semester as tuition fees. In the past, tuition fees applied solely for long-term students and second studies. Since the summer semester of 2007, all students enrolled at the RWTH Aachen had to pay these €500, if they were not exempt for one of several reasons put forth by the State of North Rhine-Westphalia.\r\n\r\nSince February 24, 2011 study fees were abolished by the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia (Legislation for the Improvement of Equal Opportunities to University Admission) with effect from Winter Term 2011/12. Universities will receive 249 Mio Euro of national funding for measures that improve the quality of teaching (e.g., through additional teachers and tutors) as compensation. Tuition fees per semester are still being charged.\r\nInstitute for physical chemistry\r\nFaculties\r\n\r\nThe RWTH is divided into nine (previously ten) faculties:\r\nF 1 – Faculty of Mathematics, Computer Science and Natural Sciences\r\nF 2 – Faculty of Architecture\r\nF 3 – Faculty of Civil Engineering\r\nF 4 – Faculty of Mechanical Engineering\r\nF 5 – Faculty of Georesources and Materials Engineering\r\nF 6 – Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology\r\nF 7 – Faculty of Arts and Humanities\r\nF 8 – School of Business and Economics\r\nF 10 – Faculty of Medicine\r\n\r\nFaculty nine was pedagogical sciences, but it was abandoned in 1989.

The scientists and alumni of the RWTH Aachen played a major role in chemistry, medicine, electrical, and mechanical engineering. For example, Nobel laureate Peter Debye received a degree in electrical engineering from RWTH Aachen and is known for the Debye model and Debye relaxation. Another example, Helmut Zahn and his team of the Institute for Textile Chemistry were the first who synthesised insulin in 1963 and they were nominated for Nobel Prize. Another example is B.J. Habibie, the third President of Indonesia that contributed in many aviation advancements.\r\nTrivia\r\n\r\n    Together with the lord mayor and the cathedral provost of Aachen, the rector of RWTH Aachen University is one of three automatic members of the board of directors of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen.

(3, 17, 'University of Freiburg', 'The University of Freiburg (colloquially German: Uni Freiburg), officially the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg (German: Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg), is a public research university located in Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The university was founded in 1457 by the Habsburg dynasty as the second university in Austrian-Habsburg territory after the University of Vienna. Today, Freiburg is the fifth-oldest university in Germany, with a long tradition of teaching the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. The university is made up of 11 faculties and attracts students from across Germany as well as from over 120 other countries. Foreign students constitute about 16% of total student numbers.[4]\r\n\r\nNamed as one of elite universities of Germany by academics, political representatives and the media, the University of Freiburg stands amongst Europe\'s top research and teaching institutions.[5][6][7]\r\n\r\nThe University of Freiburg has been associated with figures such as Martin Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Rudolf Carnap, David Daube, Johann Eck, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Friedrich Hayek, Edmund Husserl, Friedrich Meinecke, Max Weber, Paul Uhlenhuth and Ernst Zermelo. As of October 2018, 21 Nobel laureates are affiliated with the University of Freiburg as alumni, faculty or researchers, and 15 academics have been honored with the highest German research prize, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, while working at the university. \r\n\r\nHistory\r\nFoundation\r\nPortrait of Archduke Albert VI of Austria, founder of the University\r\n\r\nOriginally Albrechts University, the university started with four faculties (theology, philosophy, medicine, and law). Its establishment belongs to the second wave of German university foundings in the late Middle Ages, like the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen and the University of Basel. Established by papal privilege (papal bull), the University in Freiburg actually was – like all or most universities in the Middle Ages – a corporation of the church body and therefore belonged to the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy. The bishop of Basel consequently was its provost or chancellor (Kanzler), the bishop of Constance was its patron, and the real founder of the university was the sovereign, Archduke Albert VI of Austria, being the brother of Frederick III, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. At its founding, the university was named after Albert VI of Austria. He provided the university with land and endowments, as well as its own jurisdiction. Also he declared Albrechts University as the \"county university\" (German Landesuniversität) for his territory until it was handed over to the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1490.\r\nFreiburg around 1900\r\n\r\nThe university soon attracted many students, such as the humanists Geiler von Kaysersberg, Johann Reuchlin, and Jakob Wimpfeling. When Ulrich Zasius was teaching law (until 1536), Freiburg became a centre of humanist jurisprudence. From 1529 to 1535, Erasmus of Rotterdam lived and taught in Freiburg. From around 1559 on, the university was housed at the Altes Collegium (\"Old College\"), today called the \"new town-hall\". The importance of the university decreased during the time of the Counter-Reformation. To counter reformatory tendencies, the administration of two faculties was handed over to the Roman Catholic order of the Jesuits in 1620. From 1682 on, the Jesuits built their college, as well as the Jesuit church (nowadays the \"University Church\" or Universitätskirche).\r\nStudium Gallicum\r\n\r\nIn 1679, Freiburg temporarily became French territory, along with the southern parts of the upper Rhine. French King Louis XIV disliked the Austrian system and gave the Jesuits a free hand to operate the university. On November 6, 1684, a bilingual educational program was initiated. From 1686 to 1698, the faculty fled to Konstanz.\r\nAustrian reforms\r\n\r\nAfter Freiburg was re-conquered and appointed as capital of Further Austria, a new time began for the university by the reforms of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The requirements for admission were changed for all faculties in 1767 (before that time only Roman Catholics were allowed to study) and Natural Sciences were added as well as Public Administration. Also in 1767, the university became a governmental institution despite the Church\'s protests. The Church finally lost its predominant influence on the university when the Jesuits were suppressed following a decree signed by Pope Clement XIV in 1773. Consequently, Johann Georg Jacobi (brother of the more famous philosopher Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi) in 1784 was the first Protestant professor teaching at the university in Freiburg.\r\n\r\nWhen Freiburg became a part of the newly established Grand Duchy of Baden (in German \"Großherzogtum Baden\") in 1805 (after Napoleon occupied the area of the formerly Further Austria), a crisis began for the university in Freiburg. Indeed, there were considerations by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden and Karl, Grand Duke of Baden to close down the university in Freiburg while both of them thought that the Grand Duchy could not afford to run two universities at the same time (the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg had existed since 1386).\r\nUniversity of Freiburg\r\n\r\nThe university had enough endowments and earnings to survive until the beginning of the regency of Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden in 1818. Finally in 1820, he saved the university with an annual contribution. Since then, the university has been named Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg (Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg) as an acknowledgement of gratitude by the university and the citizens of Freiburg.\r\nPostage stamp by Deutsche Bundespost to commemorate the university\'s 500th anniversary in 1957\r\n\r\nIn the 1880s, the population of the student body and faculty started to grow quickly. The scientific reputation of Albert Ludwigs University attracted several researchers such as economist Adolph Wagner, historians Georg von Below and Friedrich Meinecke, and jurists Karl von Amira and Paul Lenel.\r\nKollegiengebäude I, erected in 1913 as the main building of the university\r\n\r\nIn 1900, Freiburg became the first German university to accept female students. In the beginning of the 20th century, several new university buildings were built in the centre of Freiburg, such as the new main building in 1911. The university counted 3,000 students just before World War I. After World War I, the philosophers Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger (since 1928) taught at Albert Ludwigs University, as well as Edith Stein. In the field of social sciences, Walter Eucken developed the idea of ordoliberalism, which subsequently is known as the \"Freiburg School\".\r\nThird Reich\r\n\r\nDuring the Third Reich, the university went through the process of \"political alignment\" (Gleichschaltung) like the rest of the German universities. Under the rector Martin Heidegger, all Jewish faculty members were forced to leave the university in accordance with the \"Law for the Reintroduction of Professional Civil Service\".\r\nPostwar years\r\nThe University of Freiburg in 1961\r\n\r\nAfter World War II, the university was reopened. New buildings for natural sciences were erected in the Institutsviertel (\"institute quarter\"). In the postwar years, the ideas of ordoliberalism, developed earlier by economists of the Freiburg School, such as Walter Eucken, Franz Böhm, Hans Grossmann-Doerth, and Leonhard Miksch, drove the creation of the German social market economy and its attendant Wirtschaftswunder. Nobel Prize winner and former professor at the University of Freiburg, Friedrich Hayek, is also associated with this theory. He directed the Walter Eucken Institut, an economic think tank in Freiburg cooperating with the university. Arnold Bergstraesser, considered a founding father or German political science after World War II, was also a professor at the University of Freiburg. His research group later formed what is now the Arnold Bergstraesser Institute for sociocultural research at the university.\r\n\r\nIn the late 20th century, the university was part of a mass education campaign and expanded rapidly. The student body grew to 10,000 by the 1960s, and doubled to 20,000 students by 1980. In the 1970s, the faculty structure was changed to 14 departments, with the Faculty of Engineering becoming the 15th faculty in 1994. In 2002, the number of faculties was reduced to 11. The university opened a memorial dedicated to the victims of National Socialism among the students, staff, and faculty in 2003.[8]\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the University of Freiburg joined the League of European Research Universities (LERU). One year later, the University was chosen as one of nine German Universities of Excellence. However, it did not receive the third line of funding in 2012.\r\nThe university seal is set into the floor at the entrance of the largest lecture hall - auditorium maximum\r\nUniversity seal\r\n\r\nThe seal of the University of Freiburg depicts the educator Christ seated on a gothic throne holding the gospel in his right hand with the temple curtain in the background. Christ offers the teachings of the gospel to the Jewish scholars who are crouched at his feet. To the left and right of Christ are structures resembling towers, most likely symbolic of the Temple of Jerusalem. Located to the right of Christ is the coat of arms of the Austrian duchies, a banner with five eagles. The shield on the opposite side symbolizes the coat of arms used by the Habsburgs in conjunction with their territories. The coat of arms of the city of Freiburg is located at the bottom of the seal, displaying St George\'s Cross. The Latin inscription on the seal reads Sigillum universitatis studii friburgensis brisgaudie. The seal was slightly modified in 1913, but has otherwise been in continuous use since it was adopted in 1462.[9]\r\nCampus\r\nAristotle, in front of the Kollegiengebäude I\r\n\r\nHaving grown with the city since the 15th century, the university\'s buildings are deeply intertwined with the city. The three large campuses are the university center next to the historical city center, the institutes quarter, and the engineering campus, but other buildings can be found scattered throughout Freiburg.\r\nThe Department of Surgery at the University Medical Center\r\n\r\nThe university complex in the historical center of Freiburg contains such picturesque buildings as the Jugendstil Kollegiengebäude I, built in 1911 by Hermann Billing, and the gothic revival old university library. The current University Library is also located in the historical center; it is a monumental building erected in the 1970s, and was to be renovated and redesigned beginning in September, 2008.[10] It is one of the largest in Germany and placed fourth in an October, 2007, German national ranking of university libraries.[11]\r\n\r\nThe University Church, located across from Kollegiengebäude II, was built in 1683 by the Jesuit order. The church and the Jesuit college were handed over to the university after the Jesuit order was suppressed in 1773. The church was destroyed in the November 27, 1944, bombing raid on Freiburg, and reconstructed in 1956.[12]\r\n\r\nThe “institute quarter” (Institutsviertel) is home to the science faculties. This campus was destroyed almost completely in the Freiburg bombing raid in 1944. After World War II, the reconstruction of the institutes began. Today, the quarter houses the physics buildings, the tall main chemistry building, visible from afar, the famous Institute for Macromolecular Chemistry at the Hermann-Staudinger-Haus, various other science buildings, and the renowned preclinical institutes of the Faculty of Medicine.\r\nThe University Library in Freiburg\r\n\r\nThe engineering campus is located next to the small Freiburg airfield to the northwest of the city center, close to the University Medical Center. The campus is home to the Institut für Mikrosystemtechnik ( Department of Microsystems Engineering) and the Department of Computer Science. With the addition of the Faculty of Engineering, the University of Freiburg became the first classical university to combine traditional disciplines with microsystems technologies.\r\n\r\nThe University Medical Center (Universitätsklinikum Freiburg) is one of Germany\'s largest medical centers. It boasts 1,600 beds and handles 55,000 in-patients a year, with another 357,000 being treated as out-patients. It consists of 13 specialized clinics, five clinical institutes, and five centers (e.g. Center for Transplantation Medicine). The University Medical Center achieved many technical advances, such as the first implantation of an artificial heart Jarvik 2000 in 2002.\r\n\r\nMost recently, the University of Freiburg purchased a large historic villa in the district of Herdern, which will house part of the literature and linguistics, as well as history departments of the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, the University of Freiburg opened its new library, housed in a modern building with a large glass and chrome facade. The library features a section for quiet work and the permanent collection as well as space for group work, where collaboration is encouraged. The building also includes a student cafe and an outdoor plaza with modern sculpture.\r\nStudents and admission\r\nKollegiengebäude IV, Humanities Faculty (former University Library)\r\n\r\nThe university has a combined undergraduate and graduate student population of around 21,600.[4] About 16% of these students are foreigners, from about 120 different countries. Admission largely depends on the faculty and program applied for and is strictly merit based, with the average score of final secondary-school examinations (German Abitur) or A-levels playing an important role. Overall, in the fall of 2010, roughly 4,000 of around 26,000 applicants were admitted.[13]\r\n\r\nThe University of Freiburg offers a large variety of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral degree programs at its 11 faculties in 150 fields of study.[14]\r\n\r\nAs common among German universities, the academic year consists of summer and winter terms (semesters). The winter term runs from October 1 to March 31, while the summer term runs from April 1 to September 30. However, lectures and classes usually do not run for the full duration of these periods and allow for breaks in spring and fall.\r\n\r\nAs a German university, tuition is free. However, the University of Freiburg does charge a 210 EUR fee per year for all undergraduate and most graduate and doctoral programs, regardless of the EU or non-EU citizenship of students.\r\nStudent life\r\n\r\nNumerous student clubs and organizations are active, among them a campus radio station, echo-fm,[15] and a student television station, alma*,[16] which is also available as a podcast. Because of the nearby French and Swiss borders and the adjacent Black Forest, where the university owns a retreat on Schauinsland Mountain, fine opportunities exist for leisure and outdoor activities. Students come from Central and Eastern Europe for language studies, the majority demographic category is females in age range 18-25 (58%).\r\n\r\nThe university provides student housing in its various dormitories, run by the Studentenwerk. Additionally, further dormitories in Freiburg are operated by other institutions, such as the Catholic Archdiocese or the Evangelical Church. Due to the affordable rent and limited spots, rooms in the various dormitories are very popular. Many students find private living arrangements, such as Wohngemeinschaften (shared apartments). However, the popularity of Freiburg for prospective students can make finding an apartment or room quite time-consuming, especially before the start of the academic terms.\r\n\r\nThe university has its own career center, singled out as one of the best in Germany by the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft.[17]\r\nAcademics\r\nExcellence initiative\r\nUniversity Church, Freiburg\r\n\r\nThe university scored well with its submissions to the German Universities Excellence Initiative. The university received funding in all three categories. In the first category, funding for a new graduate school, the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, was granted; in the second, funding was granted for the excellence cluster Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (bioss); and in the third category, Institutional Strategy Line of Funding, open only to institutions with submissions qualified in the first two categories, the university is receiving funding for \"Windows for Research\", which aims to promote a high level of interdisciplinarity between research fields and attract scientists from all over the world. To that end, the university founded the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS). Being selected for the third category ranks Freiburg as one of nine \"excellence universities\" in Germany. The University is to receive over EUR 130 million in additional funds over five years (from 2007) from this third category of funding.[18][19] In 2009, the University was also successful in a nationwide competition for excellence in teaching, held by the Stifterverband der deutschen Wissenschaft. The University of Freiburg, with its plans for future innovative teaching concepts, was selected as one of 10 winners from a field of over 100 higher education institutions.[20]\r\n\r\nIn 2012, in the third round of the Excellence Initiative, the university was able to successfully extend funding for the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, as well as bioss, while also gaining funding for a new cluster called BrainLinks-Brain Tools, an interdisciplinary neurotechnology project. Citing insufficient evidence of integration of the FRIAS concept into the university\'s framework, the committee did not extend funding for the FRIAS and the institutional strategy line of funding, despite acknowledging the impressive research and advances achieved at FRIAS in the past years.[21]\r\nReputation\r\nUniversity rankings\r\nGlobal\r\nARWU World[22] 	101-150\r\nTHE World[24] 	76\r\nUSNWR World[25] 	148\r\nQS World[23] 	186\r\n\r\nIn university rankings published by German magazines and periodicals (Der Spiegel, Die Zeit, Focus, etc.[26][27]) the University of Freiburg has established itself as one of Germany\'s top universities.[28] The faculties for law, medicine, economics, history, English studies, German studies, biology, dentistry, and pharmacology achieve especially high scores.[29][30][31] In regards to the natural sciences, the University of Freiburg ranked sixth in Europe and second in Germany[6] in a ranking of the European Commission of the universities according to their overall impact on scientific research. The Centre for Higher Education Development, a German higher education think tank, periodically publishes a comprehensive ranking of European Master\'s and PhD programs. Freiburg garnered five spots in the top Excellence Group among seven subject fields examined.[32] In a recent survey by the Nature Publishing Group, the Nature Publishing Index - 2012 Global Top 100, the University of Freiburg was the highest-ranked German university and ranked 66th worldwide and 18th in Europe.[33] A recent study, \"Benchmarking China and Germany: An Analysis of Patent Portfolios of Universities and Research Organizations\", was published in May 2013 and sought to evaluate leading universities and research institutions in Germany and China in regards to their patent applications. The study placed the University of Freiburg as the third-most innovative university in Germany in terms of total patent applications.[34]\r\nCurrent affairs\r\n\r\nTeams of the University of Freiburg frequently participate in academic competitions with considerable success. The moot court team of the Faculty of Law has been the most successful team in the history of the competition Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot. The humanoid robot team of the Faculty of Engineering regularly competes with distinction in international tournaments.[35] The University of Freiburg team has also repeatedly scored highly at the international Genetically Engineered Machine]] undergraduate synthetic biology competition held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[36] The team was supported by numerous university institutions, among them the recently established bioss cluster of excellence. The University of Freiburg also participates in the National Model United Nations held annually in New York City.\r\n\r\nThe genetically engineered golden rice was developed by the University of Freiburg (Peter Beyer) and the ETH Zurich (Ingo Potrykus) from 1992 to 2000. It was considered a breakthrough in biotechnology at the time of publication and now can help to provide vitamin A to people lacking access to it in their diets.\r\n\r\nWhen previous rector Prof. Dr. Jäger retired in 2008, law professor Prof. Dr. Andreas Voßkuhle was chosen as his successor. However, shortly after the start of his term, the Social Democratic Party of Germany nominated Voßkuhle as vice-president of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. Voßkuhle accepted the nomination, was confirmed, and took his seat on the court in May 2008. In July 2008, then vice-rector Prof. Dr. Hans-Jochen Schiewer was elected as successor to Voßkuhle. Schiewer has assumed the position of rector with the start of the winter term 2008/2009.\r\n\r\nThe University of Freiburg offers educational audio and video content on the iTunes U software platform since January 2008.\r\n\r\nThe University of Freiburg Institute of Physics is actively involved with research at the Large Hadron Collider and has contributed significantly to the ATLAS experiment, resulting in the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.\r\nOrganization and faculties\r\n\"Die Wahrheit wird euch frei machen\" (The truth will set you free)\r\n\r\nToday, about 430 professors, 3,695 academic employees, and 8,644 non-academic employees at the university are working for the Albert Ludwigs University, making it Freiburg\'s and the region\'s biggest employer. The university attracts many academics from abroad and was awarded excellent positions in the 2005 and 2009 Humboldt Ranking.[37][38]\r\nFaculties\r\n\r\nThe university is headed by a rector and divided into 11 faculties:\r\n\r\n    Faculty of Theology\r\n    Faculty of Law\r\n    Faculty of Medicine\r\n    Faculty of Economics and Behavioural Sciences\r\n    Faculty of Philology\r\n    Faculty of Philosophy (history, sociology, etc.)\r\n    Faculty of Mathematics and Physics\r\n    Faculty of Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Geosciences\r\n    Faculty of Biology\r\n    Faculty of Forest and Environmental Sciences\r\n    Faculty of Engineering\r\n\r\nGraduate schools\r\nKollegiengebäude II and central university square\r\n\r\nThe University of Freiburg has a variety of graduate education and research opportunities. In an evaluation of European graduate programs, Freiburg was ranked among the leading universities in several subject fields examined.[39][40]\r\n\r\nOne of the notable graduate opportunities is the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies, a project funded by the German Excellence Initiative.\r\n\r\nApart from the many graduate programs of its faculties, Freiburg has set up additional specialized graduate schools and graduate research centers, coordinated by the newly founded International Graduate Academy (IGA) Freiburg. The IGA coordinates five graduate schools: the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine; the European Cultures and Intercultural Interweaving school; the Theology and Religious Studies school; the Hermann Paul School of Language Sciences, and the Environment, Society and Global Change graduate school of the Faculty of Forest and Environmental Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe IGA also coordinates 12 Graduate Research Centers (Graduiertenkolleg): Biochemistry of Enzymes; Friends, Patrons, Clients; Formation and Development of Present-Day Landscapes; Mathematical Logics and Applications; Mechanisms of Neuronal Signal Transduction; Catalysts and Catalytic Reactions for Organic Synthesis (in cooperation with the University of Basel); Hadron Collider Physics; Embedded Microsystems; From Cells to Organs: Molecular Mechanisms of Organogenesis; Signal Systems in Model Organisms of Plant Origin; Micro Energy Harvesting; and PhD program Computational Neuroscience at the Bernstein Center Freiburg for Computational Neuroscience and Neurotechnology.\r\n\r\nFinally, the university operates three joint graduate schools with the Max Planck Society: the International Max Planck Research School for Molecular and Cellular Biology; the International Max Planck Research School on Retaliation, Mediation and Punishment; and the International Max Planck Research School for Comparative Criminal Law.\r\n\r\nTogether with the EUCOR universities of Basel and Strasbourg and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, the University of Freiburg also runs the shared graduate school École supérieure de biotechnologie Strasbourg, enabling the students to obtain an international degree in biotechnology and a trilingual education, as classes are taught in English, German, and French.\r\nInternational language courses\r\n\r\nThe University of Freiburg has offered German language courses for foreign students since 1911. The courses take place at the university\'s Language Teaching Centre (\'Sprachlehrinstitut) during the semester breaks and attract students from over 50 nations to Freiburg. The intensive language lessons are bolstered by a supplementary program with lectures and seminars on German culture, politics, philosophy, and art, as well as excursions to the Black Forest, the Alsace region in France, Basel (Switzerland) or Lake Constance. In addition to classes for all language levels, professional German courses (e.g. business German) are also offered.\r\nUniversity College Freiburg\r\nLogo at the entrance of University College Freiburg\r\n\r\nUniversity College Freiburg (UCF) is the University’s central facility for promoting and administering international, interdisciplinary teaching activities. It complements and supports the faculties’ work in this field, serves as a laboratory for innovative approaches to teaching and instructional design, and houses high-profile projects, notably the bachelor\'s program in Liberal Arts and Sciences. This four-year degree is the University of Freiburg’s first interdisciplinary, English-taught undergraduate program and the first of its kind in Germany. It started in October 2012. UCF works in close co-operation with the faculties, the Rectorate’s departments for Instructional Development and International Relations, and with the Language Teaching Center.\r\nSustainability\r\nThe green at the central mensa (cafeteria) on Rempartstraße\r\n\r\nThe city of Freiburg is known for its environmentally friendly policies and focus on renewable energy and sustainability, attracting solar industry and research to the city. This environmentally conscious attitude also extends to the University of Freiburg which has founded the work group \"Nachhaltige Universität Freiburg\" (Sustainable University of Freiburg) and has drawn up environmental guidelines to be implemented in university practice.\r\n\r\nThe university has also founded the initiative Solar-Uni Freiburg in 2007, with the aim of further expanding its capabilities in sustainability and environmental research. Solar panels were installed on the roofs of university buildings. To bundle renewable energy research and teaching at the university, the Center for Renewable Energy (ZEE, Zentrum für Erneuerbare Energien), an interdisciplinary and cross-faculty facility, was founded. Aside from research in the fields of solar energy, biomass, geothermal energy, energy efficiency and new energies, an international Master of Science degree in Renewable Energy Management is being offered.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its own expertise, the Center for Renewable Energy can draw upon the support of the renewable energy industrial sector in Freiburg, as well as the university\'s cooperation with other research institutes in the area, such as the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, the Öko-Institut - Institute for Applied Ecology, or the University of Applied Sciences Offenburg.\r\nUniversity cooperation\r\nLocal partner institutions\r\n\r\nThe University of Freiburg cooperates closely with external research institutions located in Freiburg, several of which are connected with chairs at the university.[41]\r\n\r\nCollaborating institutions include:\r\n\r\n    the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community Kiepenheuer-Institut für Sonnenphysik\r\n    the Bernstein Center Freiburg\r\n    the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics\r\n    the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law\r\n    the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Fire Ecology Research Group\r\n    the Arnold Bergstraesser Institute for Socio-Cultural Research (ABI)\r\n\r\n	\r\n\r\n    the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid-State Physics\r\n    the Fraunhofer Institute for High-Speed Dynamics (Ernst-Mach-Institut)\r\n    the Fraunhofer Institute for Physical Measurement Techniques\r\n    the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\r\n    the Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials\r\n    the Confucius Institute\r\n\r\nInternational cooperation\r\nThe Institute for Medical Ethics and History of Medicine and the Institute for Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the Faculty of Medicine.\r\n\r\nThe university is part of the regional EUCOR federation together with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, the universities of Basel, Mulhouse, and, marked by particularly close ties, Strasbourg.[42] Freiburg is further a member of the League of European Research Universities; the European University Association; ASEA-Uninet; AC21; and the International Forum of Public Universities (IFPU). The university also has exchange agreements and cooperative efforts with renowned universities on almost every continent.\r\n\r\nThe University of Freiburg initiated an English language international master\'s program in social sciences, the Global Studies Programme (GSP) in 2001. The aim of the program is to enable students to study social sciences in different regions and cultures. Combining various disciplines such as sociology, political sciences, anthropology and geography, students approach globalization with a unique perspective. The program is conducted jointly by the University of Freiburg with the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa, the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India, the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and the Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand. Students in the GSP master\'s program study on three different continents during the two-year degree program. Since 2008, the GSP also offers a PhD program in Global Studies. The Global Studies Program has received many awards, among them the BMW Group Award for Intercultural Learning in 2004 as well as being listed a Top Ten International master\'s degree Course in Germany by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) in 2006.[43]\r\n\r\nThe university also supports the Institute for Russian-German Literature and Cultural Relations at the Russian State University for the Humanities as well as the Vladimir Admoni School for Doctoral Studies at the University of Latvia.\r\n\r\nApproximately 1/6th of its students are international students. Many students at this university participate in the ERASMUS exchange program. ');

(3, 18, 'Karlsruhe Institute of Technology', 'The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) (German: Karlsruher Institut für Technologie) is a public research university and one of the largest research and educational institutions in Germany. KIT was created in 2009 when the University of Karlsruhe (Universität Karlsruhe), founded in 1825 as a public research university and also known as the \"Fridericiana\", merged with the Karlsruhe Research Center (Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe), which had originally been established in 1956 as a national nuclear research center (Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe, or KfK) .[3]\r\n\r\nKIT is one of the leading universities for engineering and the natural sciences in Europe, ranking sixth overall in citation impact.[4] KIT is a member of the TU9 [5] German Institutes of Technology e.V. As part of the German Universities Excellence Initiative KIT was awarded an excellence status in 2006. In the 2011 performance ranking of scientific papers, Karlsruhe ranked first in Germany and among the top ten universities in Europe in engineering and natural sciences.[6] Ranked 26th worldwide in computer science in the internationally recognized \"Times Higher Education\" ranking, KIT is among the leading universities worldwide in computer science[7].\r\n\r\nAs of 2018, six Nobel laureates are affiliated with KIT. The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is well known for many inventors and entrepreneurs who studied or taught there, including Heinrich Hertz, Karl Friedrich Benz and the founders of SAP SE.[8] \r\n\r\nHistory\r\nFridericiana, founded in 1825\r\n\r\nThe University of Karlsruhe was founded as a polytechnical school (Polytechnische Schule) on 7 October 1825. It was modelled on the École polytechnique in Paris. In 1865, Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden raised the school to the status of a Hochschule, an institution of higher education. Since 1902 the university has also been known as the Fridericiana in his honour. In 1885, it was declared a Technische Hochschule, or institute of technology, and in 1967, it became an Universität, a full university, which gave it the right to award regular doctorate degrees. It had hitherto only been allowed to award doctorates in engineering, identified as Dr.-Ing., a right bestowed on all technical institutes in 1899.\r\nThe Victoriapensionat I\r\n\r\nThe University of Karlsruhe is one of the leading German institutions in computer science. A central computer laboratory was founded in 1966. The department of informatics was established three years later, along with the first regular course in informatics.[9] On 2 August 1984, the university received Germany\'s first email. The Institut für Meteorologie und Klimaforschung (Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research) was founded at the university in 1985.\r\n\r\nThe university also cooperated extensively with the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Research Centre), and this relationship was formalised on 6 April 2006 when Professor Horst Hippler and Dr. Dieter Ertmann from the University of Karlsruhe, and Professor Manfred Popp and Assistant Jur. Sigurd Lettow from Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe signed a contract for the foundation of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The name was inspired by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the leading technical university in the United States.[10] In February 2008, the merger of the university and the research centre to form KIT was agreed by the state of Baden-Württemberg and Germany\'s federal government.[11] The necessary state law was passed on 8 July 2009.[12] KIT was formally established on 1 October 2009.\r\nKarlsruhe Palace at left and the Faculty for Business and Economics of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology on the right\r\n\r\nThe main reason for establishing KIT was to strengthen Karlsruhe\'s position in the German Universities Excellence Initiative, which offered elite universities grants of up to 50 million euros per annum. This aim was not achieved. While the University of Karlsruhe was chosen for the initiative in 2006/2007, KIT failed to secure a place in 2012. It did, however, attract funds from other sources. In 2008, Hans-Werner Hector, co-founder of SAP, raised 200 million euros to support researchers at the institute. (Hector is the only founder of SAP who did not graduate from the University of Karlsruhe; he was given an honorary doctorate for his support of intellectually gifted children in 2003.)\r\nInstitute of Electric Engineering at KIT\r\nCampus\r\nCampus Nord\r\nKIT locations in Germany and Karlsruhe\r\n\r\nThe Campus Nord (Campus North), the former Forschungszentrum, was founded in 1956 as Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe (KfK) (Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Centre). Initial activities focused on Forschungsreaktor 2 (FR2), the first nuclear reactor built by Germany. With the decline of nuclear energy activities in Germany, Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe directed its work increasingly towards alternative areas of basic and applied sciences. This change is reflected in the change of name from Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe to Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe with the subheading Technik und Umwelt (technology and environment) added in 1995. This subheading was replaced by in der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft (in the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers) in 2002.\r\n\r\nCampus Nord is the site of the main German national nuclear engineering research centre and the Institute for Transuranium Elements. Also at the site is a nanotechnology research centre and the neutrino experiment KATRIN.\r\n\r\nCampus Nord also hosts a 200-metre-tall guyed mast for meteorological measurements.\r\nOrganization and administration\r\nFaculties\r\n\r\nThe university has eleven faculties:\r\n\r\n    Mathematics\r\n    Physics\r\n    Chemistry and Biology\r\n    Humanities and Social sciences\r\n    Architecture\r\n    Civil engineering, Geology, and Ecological Sciences\r\n    Mechanical Engineering\r\n    Chemical and Process Engineering\r\n    Electrical engineering and Information Technology\r\n    Computer Science\r\n    Economics and Management\r\n\r\nAcademic profile\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nThe university offers a great range of education options with such possibilities as cross studies and work-study programs. A studium generale (general studies) program was established in 1949, allowing students to attend lectures not directly pertaining their study field.\r\n\r\nIn the first semesters of a course, education tends to be theoretically oriented at KIT, with a high concentration on mathematics for engineering and natural science courses. It is possible to choose between practical and theoretical topics in later semesters.\r\n\r\nSince the winter semester of 2008/2009, KIT has completed the transition from Diplom degrees to bachelor\'s degrees and master\'s degrees. Students already enrolled for a Diplom degree when the transition began were allowed to finish their studies, but new students are only allowed to apply for a bachelor\'s or master\'s degree.\r\n\r\nAdmission policies differ among the departments. While students are chosen by the quality of their school degree and their extracurricular activities for courses such as industrial engineering and management (27% of admissions in 2008),[13] other departments do not preselect for their courses, including physics, informatics, and meteorology. All courses require a minimum number of passed exams, called Orientierungsprüfungen or orientation assessments, in the first three semesters before students are allowed to complete their course. There is a substantial drop-out rate in some engineering courses due to the immense study required to meet the prerequisites.\r\n\r\nThe Zentrum für Angewandte Kulturwissenschaft und Studium Generale (Centre for Applied Culture and General Studies)[14] was founded in 1989 as a central institution to support students engaged in interdisciplinary study. Nowadays, it offers specialised qualifications in the fields of \"Leadership and Entrepreneurship\", \"Media - Culture - Communication\", \"Internationalisation and Intercultural Decision-making and Responsibility\", \"Diversity Management\", and \"European Integration and Identity Studies\", as well as the classical studium generale. There is also the possibility of concomitant study in applied culture science.[15]\r\nResearch\r\n\r\nIn 1979, the Interfakultatives Institut für Anwendungen der Informatik (Interfaculty Institute for Informatics Applications)[16] was founded. It brings together research in physics, mathematics, and engineering based on computer science. Its mathematical pendant is the Institut für Wissenschaftliches Rechnen und Mathematische Modellbildung (Institute for Scientific Calculations and Mathematical Modelling).[17] Its aim is to enhance the exchange between mathematics and engineering in the fields of scientific calculations.\r\n\r\nThe Interfakultatives Institut für Entrepreneurship (Interfaculty Institute for Entrepreneurship)[18] was established with SAP funding. Its teaching professors were entrepreneurs on their own. Before being shut down in 2010, a former professor of this faculty was Götz Werner, founder of dm-drogerie markt.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, the Centre for Functional Nanostructures (CFN)[19] was established. It merges the fields within material sciences, biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics which are related to nanotechnology. CFN is one of the three Exzellenzzentren (English: Excellence Institutions) of the University of Karlsruhe. Another interdisciplinary institution is the Centre for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM).\r\n\r\nThe Karlsruhe School of Optics and Photonics (KSOP)[20] was established in 2006 as a publicly funded project by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under the German Universities Excellence Initiative. KSOP was the first graduate school at the University of Karlsruhe and covers the fields of photonic materials and devices, advanced spectroscopy, biomedical photonics, optical systems and solar energy. It is supported by several of the university\'s institutes and professors. It is also a partner in the EUROPHOTONICS consortium,[21] which provides scholarship for master\'s [22] and PhD degrees[23] under the European Commission\'s prestigious Erasmus Mundus cooperation and mobility program.\r\n\r\nKIT operates several TCCON stations as part of an international collaborative effort to measure greenhouse gases globally. One station is near the campus.\r\nRankings and reputation\r\nOtto Amman Place at KIT\r\nAudimax lecture hall\r\nUniversity rankings\r\nGlobal\r\nARWU World[24] 	= 201-300\r\nTHE World[26] 	=133\r\nQS World[25] 	=107\r\n\r\nKIT is one of the leading universities in the engineering and natural sciences in Europe, ranking sixth overall in citation impact.[4] KIT is a member of the TU9[5] German Institutes of Technology e.V. As part of the German Universities Excellence Initiative KIT was awarded an excellence status in 2006. In the 2011 performance-ranking of scientific papers, Karlsruhe ranked first in Germany and among the top 10 universities in Europe in engineering and natural sciences.[6]\r\n\r\nIn the 2015 QS World University Rankings the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology achieved 93rd place in the global ranking across all disciplines and 62nd and 34th place in engineering and natural sciences, respectively.[27] In the 2013 Taiwan ranking, KIT (world rank 61) retained its position as the best German University in the engineering and natural sciences,[28] ranking in the engineering sciences ahead of the RWTH Aachen (world rank 89), the Technical University of Munich (world rank 94) and the Technical University of Dresden (world rank 108). For the natural sciences KIT (world rank 51) led the domestic comparison against the LMU Munich (world rank 62), the University of Heidelberg (world rank 72) and the Technical University of Munich (world rank 81). Ranked 26th place in computer science in the Times Higher Education Ranking 2016, KIT is one of the leading universities in computer science in Europe as well as worldwide.[29]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Ranking of Scientific Impact of Leading European Research Universities, an official document compiled by the European Commission, Karlsruhe ranks second nationally and sixth in Europe in terms of scholarly impact.[4][30]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the department of biology,[31] this university receives more funding from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft than any other university specializing in the natural sciences in Germany.[32] In the engineering sciences (computer science, electrical and mechanical engineering), the university is in the top three together with the University of Stuttgart and RWTH Aachen. It also consistently ranks top in the industrial engineering and management, with respect to the overall study situation and its popularity with employers.[33]\r\n\r\nMore than 20% of its students come from other nations and 0.6% of its students receive grants from the German Studienstiftung (German National Academic Foundation).[34] In 1998, Science Watch described its chemistry faculty as belonging to \"the cream of the crop in chemistry\" internationally.[35]\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the University of Karlsruhe was chosen to be one of three universities with the best future concept within the scope of the German Universities Excellence Initiative. These universities have been described as \"elite universities\" in the media and by the general public ever since.\r\n\r\nFor many years the Department of Computer Science has been the number-one institution in this field in Germany. Hence, the university has established an international reputation.[36]\r\nComputer facilities\r\n\r\nThe Steinbuch Centre for Computing (SCC), named after Karl Steinbuch, was formed in 2008 when the main computer facilities of the University of Karlsruhe merged with those at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. It is responsible for the university\'s IP connectivity and provides central services (Mail, Web, campus management) for students and employees. It supplies students with 10 fully equipped computer rooms, one professional print office and a wireless network providing access to the whole campus area. Some departments, like computer science, physics, and mathematics, run their own computer facilities as well.\r\n\r\nThe SCC operates some of the fastest computers in Germany:\r\n\r\n    HP XC3000 (334 nodes with 8 cores each, 27.04 TFLOPS)\r\n    HP XC4000 (750 nodes with 4 cores each, 15.77 TFLOPS)\r\n    a cluster purchased by a corporation of institutes representing different disciplines (200 nodes with 8 cores each, 17.57 TFLOPS)\r\n    the two vector parallel calculators NEC SX-8R and NEC SX-9\r\n\r\nOn 2 August 1984, Michael Rotert, a research fellow at University of Karlsruhe, received the first email ever sent to Germany, at his address rotert%germany@csnet-relay.csnet.[37]\r\n\r\nGridKa runs the Rocks Cluster Distribution Linux distribution for supercomputers.\r\nLibraries\r\n\r\nThe KIT Library with its two branches on Campus South and Campus North provides literature for research and study for about 25,000 students and 8000 scientists with a widespread, interdisciplinary book stock of over 2 million volumes, reports and 28,000 periodicals in print and electronic form. The emphasis of the collection lies in natural and engineering sciences.\r\n\r\nKIT Library South\r\n\r\nThe 24-hour library at Campus South was extended in 2006. It offers many workplaces and an area for relaxing, and is now open around the clock. The combination of a special book security system and an automated issue desk makes it possible to use the 1000 workplaces anytime, day or night. Current and contemporary literature is freely accessible in four specialised reading rooms, each providing cross-linked, modern and well-equipped study and work stations as well as printers, scanners and copy machines.\r\n\r\nKIT Library North\r\n\r\nThe research library at Campus North provides a large specialised book stock (especially reports and primary reports) on energy and nuclear energy. All literature is freely accessible to the user. Thirty modern workplaces, as well as printers, scanners, copy machines and cubicles for individual work are available.\r\n\r\nFurther libraries at KIT\r\n\r\nAdditional literature is located in two specialised reading rooms for chemistry and physics, as well as in the Library of the University of Applied Sciences at the Campus at Moltkestrasse, which is administrated by the KIT Library. The faculty of physics, the faculty of mathematics, the faculty of computer science, the faculty of architecture and the faculty of economics and management have their own libraries to supply students and researchers with topic-related literature.\r\nNotable people\r\nKarl Benz was granted the patent for the first automobile, which he built in 1885.\r\nProfessors\r\n\r\n    Karl Ferdinand Braun (1850–1918), who developed the cathode ray tube in 1897, which is widely used in televisions; in 1909 he received the Nobel Prize for the invention\r\n    Wolfgang Gaede (1878–1945), who founded vacuum technology\r\n    Franz Grashof (1826–1893), who significantly contributed to the understanding of free convection; the Grashof Number was named after him\r\n    Fritz Haber (1868–1934), who developed the high-pressure synthesis of ammonia in 1909 and won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918\r\n    Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894) discovered electromagnetic waves in 1887, which are the basis for radio transmission, and after whom the SI unit of frequency, hertz is named\r\n    Karl Heun (1859–1929), who is known for his work on numerical integration and solutions to differential equations.

(3, 19, 'University of Heidelberg', 'Heidelberg University (German: Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg; Latin: Universitas Ruperto Carola Heidelbergensis) is a public research university in Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany\'s oldest university and one of the world\'s oldest surviving universities. It was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire.[6]\r\n\r\nHeidelberg has been a coeducational institution since 1899. The university consists of twelve faculties and offers degree programmes at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in some 100 disciplines.[7] Heidelberg comprises three major campuses: the humanities are predominantly located in Heidelberg\'s Old Town, the natural sciences and medicine in the Neuenheimer Feld quarter, and the social sciences within the inner-city suburb Bergheim. The language of instruction is usually German, while a considerable number of graduate degrees are offered in English.[8]\r\n\r\nAs of 2017, 56 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with the university.[9] Modern scientific psychiatry, psychopharmacology, psychiatric genetics,[10] environmental physics,[11] and modern sociology[12] were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg faculty. Approximately 1,000 doctorates are completed every year, with more than one third of the doctoral students coming from abroad.[13][14] International students from some 130 countries account for more than 20 percent of the entire student body.[15]\r\n\r\nInternationally renowned and consistently ranked among Europe\'s top universities,[16] Heidelberg is one of the most prestigious universities in the world, a German Excellence University, part of the U15, as well as a founding member of the League of European Research Universities and the Coimbra Group. The university\'s noted alumni include eleven domestic and foreign Heads of State or Heads of Government. \r\n\r\nHistory\r\nMain article: History of Heidelberg University\r\nFounding\r\nIn 1386, Heidelberg University was founded by Rupert I on instruction of Pope Urban VI who demanded modelling it after the ancient University of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Great Schism of 1378 made it possible for Heidelberg, a relatively small city and capital of the Electorate of the Palatinate, to gain its own university.[17] The Great Schism was initiated by the election of two popes after the death of Pope Gregory XI in the same year.[17] One successor resided in Avignon (elected by the French) and the other in Rome (elected by the Italian cardinals).[17] The German secular and spiritual leaders voiced their support for the successor in Rome, which had far-reaching consequences for the German students and teachers in Paris: they lost their stipends and had to leave.[18]\r\n\r\nRupert I recognized the opportunity and initiated talks with the Curia, which ultimately led to a Papal Bull for foundation of a university. After having received, on 23 October 1385, permission from pope Urban VI to create a school of general studies (Latin: studium generale), the final decision to found the university was taken on 26 June 1386 at the behest of Rupert I, Count Palatine of the Rhine.[19] As specified in the papal charter, the university was modelled after University of Paris and included four faculties: philosophy, theology, jurisprudence, and medicine.[20]\r\n\r\nOn 18 October 1386 a special Pontifical High Mass in the Heiliggeistkirche was the ceremony that established the university.[19] On 19 October 1386 the first lecture was held,[19] making Heidelberg the oldest university in Germany.[21] In November 1386, Marsilius of Inghen was elected first rector of the university.[22] The rector seal motto was semper apertus—i.e., \"the book of learning is always open.\"[23] The university grew quickly and in March 1390, 185 students were enrolled at the university.[24]\r\nA Solemn Mass was offered in the Heiliggeistkirche in 1386 to mark and bless the establishment of the university.\r\nLate Middle Ages\r\n\r\nBetween 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the Council of Constance and acted as counselors for Louis III, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm. This resulted in establishing a good reputation for the university and its professors.[25]\r\n\r\nDue to the influence of Marsilius, the university initially taught the nominalism or via moderna. In 1412, both realism and the teachings of John Wycliffe were forbidden at the university but later, around 1454, the university decided that realism or via antique would also be taught, thus introducing two parallel ways (ambae viae).[26]\r\n\r\nThe transition from scholastic to humanistic culture was effected by the chancellor and bishop Johann von Dalberg in the late 15th century. Humanism was represented at Heidelberg University particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School Rudolph Agricola, Conrad Celtes, Jakob Wimpfeling, and Johann Reuchlin. Æneas Silvius Piccolomini was chancellor of the university in his capacity of provost of Worms, and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as Pope Pius II. In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation. In 1553, Pope Julius III sanctioned the allotment of ecclesiastical benefice to secular professors.[27]\r\nReformation and modern era\r\n\r\nMartin Luther\'s disputation at Heidelberg in April 1518 made a lasting impact, and his adherents among the masters and scholars soon became leading Reformationists in Southwest Germany. With the Electorate of the Palatinate turn to the Reformed faith, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, converted the university into a calvinistic institution. In 1563, the Heidelberg Catechism was created under collaboration of members of the university\'s divinity school.\r\n\r\nAs the 16th century was passing, the late humanism stepped beside Calvinism as a predominant school of thought; and figures like Paul Schede, Jan Gruter, Martin Opitz, and Matthäus Merian taught at the university. It attracted scholars from all over the continent and developed into a cultural and academic center.[28] However, with the beginning of the Thirty Years\' War in 1618, the intellectual and fiscal wealth of the university declined. In 1622, the then-world-famous Bibliotheca Palatina (the library of the university) was stolen from the University Cathedral and taken to Rome. The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King Louis XIV, who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely.[29][30]\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the late Counter-Reformation, the university lost its Protestant character, and was channeled by Jesuits. In 1735, the Old University was constructed at University Square, then known as Domus Wilhelmina. Through the efforts of the Jesuits a preparatory seminary was established, the Seminarium ad Carolum Borromæum, whose pupils were also registered in the university. After the suppression of the Jesuit Order, most of the schools they had conducted passed into the hands of the French Congregation of Lazarists in 1773. They deteriorated from that time forward, and the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of political economy from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an observatory in the neighboring city of Mannheim, where Jesuit Christian Mayer labored as director. In connection with the four hundredth anniversary of the university, the elector approved a revised statute book that several professors had been commissioned to prepare. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that time, the number of students varied from 300-400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated. As a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lunéville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.[31]\r\n19th and early 20th century\r\n\r\nThis decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph Görres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.[28]\r\nThe Old Assembly Hall was redesigned in 1886 in celebration of the university\'s quincentenary.\r\n\r\nThe German Students Association exerted great influence, which was at first patriotic and later political. After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity.[28] The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history. The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school.[31] The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University.[32] Heidelberg\'s professors were important supporters of the Vormärz revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. During the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them.\r\n\r\nIn the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber.[28] Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.[29]\r\nDuring the Third Reich\r\nThe main entrance of the New University building, showing the bronze bust of Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the Third Reich in 1933, the university supported the Nazis like all other German universities at the time. It dismissed a large number of staff and students for political and racial reasons. Many dissident fellows had to emigrate and most Jewish and Communist professors that did not leave Germany were deported. At least two professors directly fell victim to Nazi terror.[33] On 17 May 1933, members of the university faculty and students took part in book burnings at Universitätsplatz (\"University Square\")[34] and Heidelberg eventually became infamous as a NSDAP university. The inscription above the main entrance of the New University was changed from \"The Living Spirit\" to \"The German Spirit\",[35] and many professors paid homage to the new motto. The university was involved in Nazi eugenics: forced sterilizations were carried out at the women\'s clinic and the psychiatric clinic, then directed by Carl Schneider, was involved in Action T4 Euthanasia program.[36][37]\r\n\r\nAfter the end of World War II, the university underwent an extensive denazification.\r\nFederal Republic of Germany\r\n\r\nSince Heidelberg was spared from destruction during World War II, the reconstruction of the university was realized rather quickly. With the foundation of the Collegium Academicum, Heidelberg University became the home of Germany\'s first and, until today, only self-governed student hall. Newly laid statutes obliged the university to \"The Living Spirit of Truth, Justice and Humanity\".[29]\r\n\r\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the university grew dramatically in size. At this time, it developed into one of the main scenes of the left-wing student protests in Germany.[38] In 1975, a massive police force arrested the entire student parliament AStA. Shortly thereafter, the building of the Collegium Academicum, a progressive college in immediate vicinity to the university\'s main grounds, was stormed by over 700 police officers and closed once and for all. On the outskirts of the city, in the Neuenheimer Feld area, a large campus for medicine and natural sciences was constructed.[29]\r\n\r\nToday, about 28,000 students are enrolled for studies at Heidelberg University.[39] There are 4,196 full-time faculty, including 476 university professors.[14] In 2007, and again in 2012, the university was appointed University of Excellence under an initiative started by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Research Foundation. This enhanced the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate strong international appeal.[40]\r\nCampuses\r\nMain article: Heidelberg\r\n\r\n\"I saw Heidelberg on a perfectly clear morning, with a pleasant air both cool and invigorating. The city, just so, with the totality of its ambiance is, one might say, something ideal.\"\r\n— Johann Wolfgang von Goethe[41]\r\n\r\nHeidelberg is a city with approximately 140,000 inhabitants. It is situated in the Rhine Neckar Triangle, a European metropolitan area with approximately 2.4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen, and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter. Heidelberg is known as the cradle of Romanticism, and its old town and castle are among the most frequented tourist destinations in Germany. Its pedestrian zone is a shopping and night life magnet for the surrounding area and beyond. Heidelberg is about 40 minutes by train away from Frankfurt International Airport.[42] Heidelberg University\'s facilities are, generally speaking, separated in two parts. The faculties and institutes of humanities and social sciences are embedded in the Old Town Campus. The sciences faculties and the medical school, including three large university hospitals, are located on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld on the outskirts of Heidelberg.[43]\r\nOld Town Campus\r\nThe New University of 1931 as seen from the Old University.\r\n\r\nThe so-called New University is regarded as the center of the Old Town Campus. It is situated at the Universitätsplatz (University Square) in the pedestrian zone, in direct vicinity to the University Library and to the main administration buildings. The New University was officially opened in 1931. Its erection was largely financed by donations of wealthy American families, in line with a fundraising campaign of Jacob Gould Schurman, an alumnus of Heidelberg University and former United States Ambassador to Germany.[44] It houses the new assembly hall, the largest lecture halls, and a number of smaller seminar rooms, mostly used by faculties of humanities and social sciences. Education in humanities and social sciences takes place to a great extent in buildings spread over the ancient part of town, though most are less than ten minutes walk from University Square. The faculties maintain their own extensive libraries and work spaces for students. Seminars and tutorials are usually held in the faculty buildings.[43]\r\nNeuenheimer Feld – New Campus\r\nMain article: New Campus (Heidelberg University)\r\nAerial perspective on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s the university started building a new campus near the city district Neuenheim, called the Neuenheimer Feld. It is today the largest part of the university, and the largest campus for natural sciences and life science in Germany.[14] Almost all science faculties and institutes, the medical school, University Hospital Heidelberg, and the science branch of the University Library are situated on the New Campus. Most of the dormitories and the athletic facilities of the university can be found there as well.\r\n\r\nSeveral independent research institutes, such as the German Cancer Research Center and two of the Max-Planck-Institutes have settled there. The New Campus is also the seat of several biomedical spin-off companies. The old part of town can be reached by tram and bus in about 10 minutes. The Neuenheimer Feld campus has extensive parking lots for faculty and student vehicles for long term and short term parking, as well as visitors and patients of the various university hospitals. The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy is not located on either campus, but on the Philosophers\' Walk, separated from the Old Town by the River Neckar, and some 2 km (1.2 mi) away from the New Campus. It also maintains observatory facilities on the Königstuhl Mountain.[43]\r\nBergheim Campus\r\nThe Bergheim Campus houses Economics and the Social Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe Bergheim Campus is located in the former Ludolf Krehl clinic (named after Ludolf von Krehl) in the inner-city suburb of Heidelberg-Bergheim. Since March 2009 it has housed the institutes economics, political science, and sociology (together the Heidelberg University Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences) that formerly resided at the Old Town campus. The Bergheim campus offers one lecture theatre, several seminar rooms, the most modern of the university libraries, and a cafe (rather than the full cafeteria present in the other campuses).\r\nLibraries\r\nMain article: University Library Heidelberg\r\n\r\nThe University Library is the main library of the university, and constitutes together with the decentralized libraries of the faculties and institutes, the integral university library system comprising approximately 6.7 million printed books. It is Germany\'s most frequently used library, and it is currently placed 1st in a ranking of Germany\'s best libraries.[45] The University Library\'s stocks exceeded one million in 1934. Today, it holds about 3.2 million books, about 500,000 other media such as microfilms and video tapes, as well as 10,732 scientific periodicals. Moreover, it holds 6,600 manuscripts, most notably the Codex Manesse, 1,800 incunabula, 110,500 autographs, and a collection of old maps, paintings, and photographs. The further 83 decentralized libraries of the faculties and institutes hold another 3.5 million printed books. In 2005, 34,500 active users of the University Library accessed 1.4 million books a year. The conventional book supply is complemented by numerous electronic services. Around 3,000 commercial scientific journals can be accessed via e-journal.[46] The University Library of today traces its roots back to the purchase of a chest of documents by the first Rector Marsilius von Inghen in 1388, which was stored in the Heiliggeistkirche, then the University Cathedral. Since 1978, the science branch of the University Library serves the institutes of natural sciences and medicine on the New Campus.[46] In 2016, extensive refurbishments were finalized with the University Library now housing additional study spaces.\r\nThe main building of the University Library, built in 1905.\r\nFacilities abroad\r\n\r\nHeidelberg University founded a Center for Latin America in Santiago, Chile in 2001.[47] It has the task of organizing, managing, and marketing the courses of study maintained either independently by Heidelberg University or in cooperation with the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chile. The center has responsibility for programs of postgraduate education. It also coordinates the activities of Heidelberg University in Latin America, and provides a platform for scientific cooperation.[47]\r\n\r\nThe university is also represented by a liaison office in New York. Its main tasks include promoting existing collaborations, building up new networks, creating joint study programs, and maintaining and expanding academic contacts with American universities.[48] In addition, the Heidelberg South Asia Institute maintains branch offices in New Delhi, India; Islamabad, Pakistan; Kathmandu, Nepal; Colombo, Sri Lanka; and Kyoto, Japan.[49]\r\nOrganization\r\nGovernance\r\n\r\nThe Rectorate is the \'executive body\' of the university, headed by rector Bernhard Eitel. The rectorate consists of the chancellor, Holger Schroeter, who is the head of the central administration and responsible for the university\'s budgeting, and three pro-rectors, who are responsible for international relations, teaching and communication, and research and structure respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is the \'legislative branch\' of the university. The rector and the members of the rectorate are senators ex officio, as are also the deans of the faculties, as well as the medical and managing directors of the University Hospital, and the university\'s equal opportunities officer. Another 20 senators are elected for four-year terms, within the following quotas: eight university professors; four academic staff; four delegates of the student body; and four employees of the university administration.\r\n\r\nThe University Council is the advisory board to the aforementioned entities and encompasses, among others, the former Israeli Ambassador to Germany Avi Primor, as well as CEOs of German industries.[50]\r\nFaculties\r\n\r\nAfter a 2003 structural reformation, the university consists of 12 faculties, which in turn comprise several disciplines, departments, and institutes. As a consequence of the Bologna process, most faculties now offer Bachelor\'s, Master\'s, and Ph.D. degrees to comply with the new European degree standard. Notable exceptions are the undergraduate programs in law, medicine, dentistry and pharmacy, from which students still graduate with the State Examination, a central examination at Master\'s level held by the State of Baden-Württemberg.\r\n\r\n    The Faculty of Behavioural Sciences and Empirical Cultural Sciences\r\n    The Faculty of Biosciences\r\n    The Faculty of Chemistry and Earth Sciences\r\n    The Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences\r\n    The Faculty of Law\r\n    The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science\r\n    The Faculty of Medicine\r\n    The Faculty of Medicine in Mannheim\r\n    The Faculty of Modern Languages\r\n    The Faculty of Philosophy and History\r\n    The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy\r\n    The Faculty of Theology\r\n\r\nAssociated institutions\r\n\r\n    Network for Research on Ageing\r\n    Central Institute of Mental Health Mannheim\r\n    Heidelberg Center for American Studies\r\n    Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research,\r\n    Heidelberg State Observatory,[51]\r\n    University Hospital Heidelberg,\r\n    University Hospital Mannheim.\r\n\r\nPartnerships\r\n\r\nThe university has numerous partnerships nationally and internationally. In particular, it maintains longstanding collaborations in research and education with the following independent research institutes located in and around Heidelberg:\r\n\r\n    Center for Jewish Studies Heidelberg\r\n    European Molecular Biology Laboratory\r\n    German Cancer Research Center (Helmholtz Association)\r\n    Heavy Ion Research Center Darmstadt (Helmholtz Association),\r\n    Heidelberg University of Education\r\n    Heidelberg Academy of Sciences\r\n    Karlsruhe Research Center (Helmholtz Association)\r\n    Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (Max Planck Society)\r\n    Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law (Max Planck Society)\r\n    Max Planck Institute for Medical Research (Max Planck Society)\r\n    Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics (Max Planck Society)\r\n\r\nAcademic profile\r\nSchool statistics\r\n\r\nThe university employs more than 15,000 academic staff; most of them are physicians engaged in the University Hospital.[52] As of 2008, the faculty encompasses 4,196 full-time staff, excluding visiting professors as well as graduate research and teaching assistants. 673 faculty members have been drawn from abroad. Heidelberg University also attracts more than 500 international scholars as visiting professors each academic year. The university enrols a total of 26,741 students, including 5,118 international students. In addition there are 1,467 international exchange students at Heidelberg. 23,636 students pursue taught degrees, 4,114 of whom are international students, and 919 are international exchange students. 3,105 students pursue a doctoral degree, including 1,004 international doctoral students and 15 international exchange students. In 2007, the university awarded 994 Ph.D. degrees.[39]\r\nRankings\r\nUniversity rankings\r\nGlobal\r\nARWU World[53] 	47\r\nTHE World[55] 	47\r\nUSNWR World[56] 	54\r\nQS World[54] 	64\r\nUniversity rankings 2018-19 (overall)\r\nContinental Europe\r\nARWU\r\n	5\r\nTHE\r\n	6\r\nU.S. News & World Report\r\n	9\r\nQS\r\n	9\r\nUniversity rankings 2018-19\r\nGermany\r\nARWU\r\n	1\r\nU.S. News & World Report\r\n	2\r\nTHE\r\n	3\r\nQS\r\n	3\r\n\r\n    Ranked by the number of Nobel Laureates affiliated with the university at the time of Nobel Prize announcement, Heidelberg was placed 1st in Germany, 4th in Europe and 13th in the world by 2013.[57]\r\n    In October 2012, The New York Times ranked Heidelberg University 12th worldwide in terms of employability. The ranking was based on a survey among recruiters and managers of leading international companies from twenty countries.[58]\r\n    The Shanghai Jiao Tong University\'s Academic Ranking of World Universities ranks Heidelberg University 1st nationally and 47th in the world as of 2018.[59]\r\n    The Best Global Universities Ranking of the U.S. News & World Report ranks Heidelberg University 2nd nationally and 54th in the world as of 2019.[60]\r\n    The Times Higher Education Ranking 2019 ranks Heidelberg University 3rd in Germany, and 47th in the world.[61]\r\n    In 2019, QS World University Rankings ranks Heidelberg University 64th overall in the world, 3rd in Germany. [62]\r\n    According to the Third European Report on Science & Technology Indicators compiled by the European Commission, Heidelberg ranks 4th nationally and 9th in Europe.[63][64]\r\n    The German Center for Higher Education Development Excellence Ranking, which measures academic performance of European graduate programs in biology, chemistry, economics, mathematics, physics, political sciences, and psychology, placed Heidelberg in the European excellence group for biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and psychology.[65]\r\n    The Times (London) referred to Heidelberg University as \"the oldest and most eminent in the country of Luther and Einstein\" and as \"the jewel of German learning\".[66]\r\n\r\nOrganisation and length of courses\r\n\r\nThe academic year is divided into two semesters. The winter semester runs from 1 October to 31 March and the summer semester from 1 April to 30 September. Classes are held from mid-October to mid-February and mid-April to mid-July. Students can generally begin their studies either in the winter or the summer semester. However, there are several subjects students can begin only in the winter semester. The standard time required to finish a Bachelor\'s degree is principally six semesters, and a further four semesters for consecutive Master\'s degrees. The normal duration of Ph.D. programmes for full-time students is 6 semesters. The overall period of study for an undergraduate degree is divided into two parts: a period of basic study, lasting at least four semesters, at the end of which students must sit a formal examination, and a period of advanced study, lasting at least two semesters, after which students take their final examinations.[67]\r\nAdmission\r\n\r\nIn the winter-semester 2006/2007, the university offered 3,926 places in undergraduate programs restricted by numerus clausus, with an overall acceptance rate of 16.3%.[68] Most selective are the undergraduate programs in clinical medicine, molecular biotechnology, political science, and law, with acceptance rates of 3.6%,[69] 3.8%,[68] 7.6%[70] and 9.1%[71] respectively. The selection is exercised by allocating the best qualified applicants to a given number of places available in the respective discipline, thus depending primarily on the chosen subjects and the grade point average of the Abitur or its equivalent. For some majors and minors in humanities—particularly for conceptually non-vocational like classics and ancient history—unrestricted admission is granted under certain criteria (e.g., relevant language proficiency), as applications regularly do not exceed the number of places available.\r\nThe University Library\'s collection includes the Codex Manesse, an important German song manuscript of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nFor prospective international undergraduate students, a language test for German—such as the DSH—is required. Admission to consecutive Master\'s programs always requires at least an undergraduate degree equivalent to the German grade \"good\" (i.e., normally B+ in American, or 2:1 in British terms). Except for the Master\'s programs taught in English, a language test for German must be passed as well. Ph.D. admission prerequisite is normally a strong Master\'s-level degree, but specific admission procedures vary and cannot be generalized.[72] International applicants usually make up considerably more than 20% of the applicant pool and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective country of origin.[73]\r\nFinances\r\n\r\nThe German state heavily subsidizes university study to keep higher education affordable regardless of socio-economic background.[74] From 2007 to 2012, Heidelberg has charged tuition fees of approximately €1,200 p.a. for undergraduate, consecutive Master\'s, and doctoral programs, for both EU and non-EU citizens, and for any subject area. However, from spring term 2012 onwards, tuition fees have been abolished.[75] The usual housing costs for on-campus dormitories range from €2,200 to €3,000 p.a.[76]\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal year 2005, Heidelberg University had an overall operating budget of approximately €856 M, consisting of approximately €413 M government funds, approximately €311 M basic budget, and approximately €132 M from external grants. The university spent approximately €529 M in payroll costs and approximately €326 M in other expenditures.[77] Additionally, the university receives another €150 M in research grants, distributed over 5 years from 2012 onwards, due to the German Universities Excellence Initiative. In the fiscal year 2007, the university for the first time raised approximately €19 M through tuition fees, exclusively to further improve the conditions of study. Only approximately €9.5 M of these were spent at the end of the year and the rectorate had to urge the faculties to make use of their additional means.[78]\r\nResearch\r\nThe Center for Advanced Study Marsilius Kolleg, situated in House Buhl, was founded in 2007\r\n\r\nAmong historical scientific achievements of Heidelberg researchers features prominently the invention of spectroscopy,[79] and of the Bunsen burner;[80] the discovery of chemical elements Caesium and Rubidium;[79] the identification of the absolute point of ebullition;[81] and the identification and isolation of nicotine as the main pharmacologically active component of tobacco.[82] Modern scientific psychiatry; psychopharmacology; psychiatric genetics;[10] environmental physics;[11] and modern sociology[12] were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg faculty. Almost 800 dwarf planets, the North America Nebula, and the return of Halley\'s Comet have been discovered and documented at institutes of the Heidelberg Center for Astronomy.[83] Moreover, Heidelberg researchers invented the process of plastination to preserve body tissue,[84] conducted the first successful transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells,[85] and recently developed a new strategy for a vaccination against certain forms of cancer, which earned Professor Harald zur Hausen of the university the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008.[86]\r\n\r\nToday, the university puts an emphasis on natural sciences and medicine, but it retains its traditions with highly ranked faculties of humanities and social sciences. The Marsilius Kolleg, named after Marsilius of Inghen, was established in 2007 as a Center for Advanced Study to promote interdisciplinary dialogue and research especially between the sciences and the humanities.[87] Other institutes such as the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing, the Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences, the Heidelberg Center for American Studies, and the South Asia Institute also build a bridge between faculties and thus emphasize the concept of a comprehensive university.\r\n\r\nNoted regular publications of the Center for Astronomy include the Gliese catalogue of nearby stars, the fundamental catalogues FK5 and FK6 and the annual published Apparent places, a high precision catalog with pre-calculated positions for over 3,000 stars for each day.[88] The Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research publishes the annual Conflict Barometer, which describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements.[89] Regular publications by the Max Planck Institute for International Law include the Heidelberg Journal of International Law, the Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law; the Journal of the History of International Law; the Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law; and the semi-annual bibliography Public International Law.[90]\r\n\r\nThe German Research Foundation (DFG) currently funds twelve long-term Collaborative Research Centers (SFB) with a duration of up to 12 years at Heidelberg,[91] four Priority Programs (SPP) with a duration of six years, two Research Units (FOR) with a duration of up to six years, as well as numerous individual projects at the university\'s faculties and institutes.[92] As a result of the German Universities Excellence Initiative, two Clusters of Excellence are funded with €6.5 M each—\"Cellular Networks: From Molecular Mechanisms to Quantitative Understanding of Complex Functions\",[93] and \"Asia and Europe in a Global Context\"[94]\r\nInternational cooperations\r\n\r\nHeidelberg is a founding member of the League of European Research Universities, the Coimbra Group, and the European University Association. The university forms part of the German-Japanese University Consortium HeKKSaGOn, and it participates in 7 European exchange schemes for researchers and students, such as ERASMUS. Furthermore, it is actively involved in the development of the German-speaking Andrássy University of Budapest, and co-runs the school of German law at the Jagiellonian University of Kraków.[95] The city of Heidelberg being twinned with Cambridge, England, and Montpellier, France, there are close academic ties to the University of Cambridge and the Université de Montpellier. Beyond Europe, the university and its faculties maintain specific agreements with 58 partner universities in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and the Russian Federation. In total, the Higher Education Compass of the German Rector\'s Conference lists staff and student exchange agreements as well as research cooperations with 236 universities worldwide.[96]\r\nStudent life\r\nSports\r\nStudents rowing on the Neckar river.\r\n\r\nThe university offers a broad variety of athletics, such as teams in 16 different court sports from American football to volleyball, courses in 11 different martial arts, 26 courses in physical fitness and body building, 9 courses in health sports from aquapower to yoga, and groups in 12 different dance styles. Moreover, equestrian sports, sailing, rowing, skiing in the French alps, track and field, swimming, fencing, cycling, acrobatics, gymnastics, and much more. Most of the sports are free of charge.[97] Heidelberg\'s competition teams are particularly successful in soccer, volleyball, equestrian sports, judo, karate, track and field, and basketball. The University Sports Club men\'s basketball team, USC Heidelberg, is the championship record holder, won 13 national championships, and is the only university team playing at a professional level in the second division of Germany\'s national league.[98]\r\nGroups\r\n\r\nMoreover, the university supports a number of student groups in various fields of interest. Among them are four drama clubs, the university orchestra Collegium Musicum, four choirs, six student media groups, six groups of international students, nine groups of political parties and NGO\'s, several departments of European organizations of students in certain disciplines, four clubs dedicated to fostering international relations and cultural exchange, a chess club, a literature club, two debate societies (one focused on English debating, the other focused on German debating), one student consulting group, and four religious student groups. Student unions structure themselves as \"Studierendenrat\" (Student body council) as well as on department level.[99]\r\nMedia\r\n\r\nHeidelberg\'s student newspaper \"ruprecht\" is—with editions of more than 10,000 copies—one of Germany\'s largest student-run newspapers. It was recently distinguished by the MLP Pro Campus Press Award as Germany\'s best student newspaper. The jury of journalists from major newspapers commended its \"well balanced, though critical attitude\" and its \"simply great\" layout that \"suffices highest professional demands.\" The ruprecht is financed entirely by advertising revenues, thus retaining independence from university management. Some renowned journalists emerged from ruprecht\'s editorial board.[100]\r\n\r\nHowever, the critical online student newspaper UNiMUT, which is run by the joint student council of the faculties, criticized the ruprecht often for being conformed, and exceedingly layout-oriented.[101]\r\n\r\nHeidelberg is also home of Germany\'s oldest student law review Heidelberg Law Review. The journal is published quarterly, at the beginning and end of each semester break, and is circulated throughout all of Germany.[102]\r\nStudentenverbindung\r\n\r\nHeidelberg hosts 34 student corporations, which were largely founded in the 19th century. Corporations are to some extent comparable to the fraternities in the US. As traditional symbols (couleur) corporation members wear colored caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (Kommers) and some still practice the traditional academic fencing, a kind of duel, to \"shape their members for the challenges of life.\" In the 19th and early 20th century, corporations played an important role in Germany\'s student life. Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students. Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life. The corporations\' often representative 19th-century mansions are present throughout the Old Town.\r\nNightlife\r\nHeidelberg is not least famous for its student night life.[103] Besides the various parties regularly organized by the student councils of the faculties, the semester opening and closing parties of the university, the dormitory parties, and the soirées of Heidelberg\'s 34 student fraternities, the city, and the metropolitan area even more, offers night life for any taste and budget. Adjacent to University Square is Heidelberg\'s major night life district, where one pub is placed next to each other. From Thursday on, it is all night very crowded and full of atmosphere. Moreover, Heidelberg has five major discos. The largest of them is located at the New Campus. The city of Mannheim, which is about twice as large as Heidelberg, is a 15-minute train ride away, and offers an even more diverse night life, having a broad variety of clubs and bars well-frequented by both Heidelberg\'s and Mannheim\'s student community.

(5, 20, 'The University of Tennessee (also referr', 'The University of Tennessee (also referred to as The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, UT Knoxville, UTK, or UT) is a public sun- and land-grant university in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. Founded in 1794, two years before Tennessee became the 16th state, it is the flagship campus of the University of Tennessee system, with ten undergraduate colleges and eleven graduate colleges. It hosts almost 28,000 students from all 50 states and more than 100 foreign countries. In its 2019 universities ranking, U.S. News & World Report ranked UT 115th among all national universities and 52nd among public institutions of higher learning. Seven alumni have been selected as Rhodes Scholars. James M. Buchanan, M.S. \'41, received the 1986 Nobel Prize in Economics. UT\'s ties to nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory, established under UT President Andrew Holt and continued under the UT–Battelle partnership, allow for considerable research opportunities for faculty and students.\r\n\r\nAlso affiliated with the university are the Howard H. Baker, Jr. Center for Public Policy, the University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility, and the University of Tennessee Arboretum, which occupies 250 acres (100 ha) of nearby Oak Ridge and features hundreds of species of plants indigenous to the region. The university is a direct partner of the University of Tennessee Medical Center, which is one of two Level I trauma centers in East Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe University of Tennessee is the only university in the nation to have three presidential papers editing projects. The university holds collections of the papers of all three U.S. presidents from Tennessee—Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Andrew Johnson. UT is one of the oldest public universities in the United States and the oldest secular institution west of the Eastern Continental Divide. \r\n\r\nFounding and early days\r\n\r\nOn September 10, 1794, two years before Tennessee became a state and at a meeting of the legislature of the Southwest Territory at Knoxville, the University of Tennessee was chartered as Blount College.[8] The new, all-male, non-sectarian institution struggled for 13 years with a small student body and faculty, and in 1807, the school was rechartered as East Tennessee College as a condition of receiving the proceeds from the settlement devised in the Compact of 1806. When Samuel Carrick, its first president and only faculty member, died in 1809, the school was temporarily closed until 1820. When it reopened, it began experiencing growing pains. Thomas Jefferson had previously recommended that the college leave its confining single building in the city and relocate to a place it could spread out. Coincidentally, in the Summer of 1826 (the year that Thomas Jefferson died), the trustees explored \"Barbara Hill\" (today known simply as The Hill) as a potential site and relocated there by 1828.[9] In 1840, the college was elevated to East Tennessee University (ETU). The school\'s status as a religiously non-affiliated institution of higher learning was unusual for the period of time in which it was chartered, and the school is generally recognized as the oldest such establishment of its kind west of the Appalachian Divide.[10]\r\nReconstruction\r\n\r\nTennessee was a member of the Confederacy in 1862 when the Morrill Act was passed, providing for endowment funds from the sale of federal land to state agricultural colleges. On February 28, 1867, Congress passed a special Act making the State of Tennessee eligible to participate in the Morrill Act of 1862 program. In January 1869, ETU was designated as Tennessee\'s recipient of the Land-Grant designation and funds. In accepting the funds, the university would focus upon instructing students in military, agricultural, and mechanical subjects. ETU eventually received $396,000 as its endowment under the program. Trustees soon approved the establishment of a medical program under the auspices of the Nashville School of Medicine and added advanced degree programs. East Tennessee University was renamed the University of Tennessee in 1879 by the state legislature.[11]\r\nWorld War II\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, UT was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.[12]\r\nCivil rights era\r\n\r\nAfrican-American attorney Rita Sanders Geier filed suit against the state of Tennessee in 1968 alleging that its higher education system remained segregated despite a federal mandate ordering desegregation. She claimed that the opening of a University of Tennessee campus at Nashville, Tennessee would lead to the creation of another predominantly white institution that would strip resources from Tennessee State University, the only state-funded Historically black university. The suit was not settled until 2001, when the Geier Consent Decree resulted in the appropriation of $77 million in state funding to increase diversity among student and faculty populations among all Tennessee institutions of higher learning.[13]\r\nOrganization\r\nAyres Hall\r\nAdministration\r\n\r\nThe University of Tennessee at Knoxville is the flagship campus of the statewide University of Tennessee system, which is governed by a 26-member board of trustees appointed by the Governor of Tennessee. The campus is headed by a Chancellor who functions as the chief executive officer of the campus, responsible for its daily administration and management. The chancellor reports to the president of the university system and is elected annually by the UT Board of Trustees at the recommendation of the system president. Joseph A. DiPietro has been system president since January 1, 2011 until December 2018. Randy Boyd, a former candidate for governor, was appointed interim president while a search has been convened. Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Susan D. Martin is responsible for the academic administration of the Knoxville campus and reports directly to the Chancellor.[14]\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 2016, the UT Board of Trustees confirmed Beverly J. Davenport as the next Chancellor of the Knoxville campus, succeeding Jimmy Cheek. She began her role on February 15, 2017, and is the first female Chancellor for UT.[15] On May 2, 2018, UT President Joe DiPietro fired Davenport. DiPietro cited poor communication and interpersonal skills, amongst other reasons. The decision received criticism from the student body and faculty, as these reasons were also listed as strengths of Davenport, and why DiPietro chose to hire her a little over one year earlier.[16]\r\n\r\nCampus policing and security is provided by the University of Tennessee Police Department.\r\nBudget\r\n\r\nUniversity of Tennessee Knoxville (2015)[17]\r\n\r\n    Educational and General Total: $578,766,711\r\n        Instruction: $263,257,573\r\n        Research: $41,848,637\r\n        Public Service: $11,287,642\r\n        Academic Support: $67,888,051\r\n        Student Services: $39,438,427\r\n        Institutional Support: $45,015,257\r\n        Operation/Maintenance of Physical Plant: $69,694,749\r\n        Scholarships and Fellowships: $59,827,375\r\n    Total budget: $758,407,168\r\n\r\nAccording to the University\'s 2009 budget, state appropriations increased 26.4 percent from 2000 to 2009, although this amounts to only a 1.1 percent when adjusted for inflation.[18]\r\nUniversity Medical Center\r\n\r\nThe University of Tennessee Medical Center, administered by University Health Systems and affiliated with the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine, collaborates with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center to attract and train the majority of its medical staff.

(5, 21, 'University of Essex', 'The University of Essex is a public research university in Essex, England. It was established in 1963, welcomed its first students in 1964 and received its Royal Charter in 1965. Essex\'s motto, \"Thought the harder, heart the keener\", is adapted from the Anglo-Saxon poem The Battle of Maldon.\r\n\r\nEssex\'s largest campus is the Colchester Campus within Wivenhoe Park, less than a mile (1.6 km) from Wivenhoe and two miles (3 km) from Colchester. There is also a campus in Southend-on-Sea and East 15 Acting School is based at the Loughton Campus.\r\n\r\nEssex has collaborative partnerships with 18 institutions around the world. UK partnerships include Kaplan Open Learning (provider of University of Essex Online), Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust and University of Essex International College. International partnerships include a franchise arrangement with Kaplan Singapore and double and dual degrees with several universities in Europe and Asia[5].\r\n\r\nEssex was named University of the Year[6] at the Times Higher Education Awards in November 2018. The Research Excellence Framework (REF) in 2014 ranked Essex in the top twenty universities in the UK for the quality of its research and the top five for social science.[7] Essex is in the top 50 for the social sciences and law in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2018 by subject.[8][9] Overall Essex is ranked 251st-300th in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2019[10] and 29th in the UK in The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2019[11].\r\n\r\nEssex has produced many notable alumni in several fields, including two Nobel Laureates, prominent scientists, artists, and politicians. In addition, there are two former academics who are Nobel Laureates. \r\n\r\nFounding\r\nThe Albert Sloman Library\r\n\r\nIn July 1959, Essex County Council accepted a proposal from Alderman Leatherland that a university be established in the county. A University Promotion Committee was formed chaired by Lord Lieutenant of Essex, Sir John Ruggles-Brise, which submitted a formal application to the University Grants Committee requesting that a University of Essex should be established. Initial reports suggested that the Promotion Committee had recommended Hylands Park in Chelmsford as the site for the new university, however in May 1961, the foundation of the university was announced in the House of Commons with Wivenhoe as the preferred location and in December of the same year, Wivenhoe Park was acquired for the new university. In July 1962, Albert Sloman, Gilmour Professor of Spanish and Dean of the Faculty of Arts, University of Liverpool, was appointed as Vice-Chancellor andR. A. Butler, was invited to be Chancellor, with Anthony Rowland-Jones appointed as Registrar.\r\n\r\nThe first Professors were appointed in May 1963: Alan Gibson in Physics, Peter Townsend in Sociology, Donald Davie in Literature, Richard Lipsey in Economics, Ian Proudman in Mathematics, Jean Blondel in Government, and John Bradley in Chemistry. With its first staff appointed, a development plan for the university was published and a £1million Appeal Fund was launched. Within six months the Appeal Fund had exceeded its £1million target with The Queen Mother and Sir Winston Churchill among contributors, while work began on clearing the site for building work. In Autumn 1963, red was chosen as the university colour and the first prospectus was prepared and work began on the first permanent buildings; the science block and boiler room next to Wivenhoe House. In January 1964, Hardy Amies designed the university\'s academic robes and temporary teaching huts had to be erected close to Wivenhoe House, while in March Sir John Ruggles-Brise was appointed the first Pro-Chancellor and Alderman Leatherland the first Treasurer of the university. Two months later the university\'s Armorial Bearings were published, with the motto \"Thought the harder, heart the keener\".\r\nSquare 5 seen from outside the library\r\nExpansion during the 1960s\r\n\r\nIn October 1964, the first 122 students arrived with 28 teaching staff in three schools: Comparative Studies, Physical Sciences and Social Studies. Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Government, Sociology, Literature, Mathematics and Economics open along with the Language Centre (later the Department of Language and Linguistics) and the Computing Centre (later the Department of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering) with Denis Mesure elected as the first President of the Students\' Council. Work started on the first residential tower, Rayleigh, in December with The Queen approving the grant of Charter to take effect from 11 January 1965.\r\n\r\n1965 brought 399 students enrolling for the start of the new academic year; the number of academic staff more than doubled to 61; and the first degrees, five MSc and five MA degrees were awarded. The Physics building opened and the first six floors of Rayleigh tower were ready for occupation, while work began on the Albert Sloman Library. The first female lecturer was appointed: Dorothy E. Smith in the Department of Sociology. In December, University Court met for the first time with around 500 members. Six months later, work started on the Lecture Theatre Building, plus the \'Topping out\' of Keynes tower.\r\n\r\nIn October 1966, the Hexagon Restaurant and General Store opened, with the number of students reaching 750. Lord Butler was installed as Chancellor at a ceremony held in Colchester\'s Moot Hall in 1967 and the first Honorary Degrees were presented, the university\'s mace was carried for the first time, while the first annual Degree Congregation saw 135 degrees conferred in July. At the start of the next academic year, the departments of Computer Science and Electronic Systems Engineering accepted their first students, the SSRC Data Bank (later renamed the UK Data Archive) was established and the Lecture Theatre Building and Library opened along with the first phase of the Social and Comparative Studies building, while work proceeded on Tawney and William Morris residential towers.\r\nMay 1968 protests\r\nOne of the lakes\r\n\r\nThe University of Essex was at the forefront of 1960s student unrest. At a time of worldwide protest against the Vietnam War, the student movement was taking off all over the world. In March 1968, a demonstration against a visit to the university by Enoch Powell received national publicity. Seven students were summoned to disciplinary hearings but student sit-ins prevented these hearings taking place.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, 7 May 1968, Dr Thomas Inch from Porton Down came to give a lecture at the university. In a carefully planned demonstration, an indictment was read out as Inch attempted to speak, citing chemical and biological warfare activities at Porton Down. University authorities called in police with dogs, probably for the first time in an English university. Students outnumbered police and managed to prevent arrests.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, 10 May, three students, Pete Archard, Raphael Halberstadt and David Triesman (now Lord Triesman) were suspended and ordered off the campus. No evidence or charges were notified to the students, and no opportunity was given for the students to present their defence.\r\n\r\nThe university\'s magazine, Wyvern,[12] reported that on Monday, 13 May, \"Students picket all entrances to the university from early morning distributing leaflets calling all students and staff to meeting to discuss suspension of the three students. A huge meeting attended by nearly all the university population, voted overwhelmingly to refuse to participate in the university – in its place a Free University was declared \". After a week the three students were reinstated.[13]\r\n\r\nMany Essex students joined protests in Paris over the summer of 1968 and unrest on the Colchester campus continued into 1969[14].\r\n\r\nA documentary titled Mustard covering the 1968 protests and the aftermath including interviews with participants has been created by Essex academic Dr John Haynes[15]. Extensive archive material was also released on The Mustard Project website to mark the 50th anniversary of the protests[16].\r\nThe south student residence towers, Bertrand Russell (left) and Eddington (right)\r\nThe 1970s and the 1980s\r\n\r\nBetween the 1970s and the 1980s, the university added a health centre, day nursery, printing centre, bookstore, exhibition gallery and expanded the current student residences. New student residences were also constructed. The departments of philosophy, school of law, human rights centre and the department of biological sciences were opened.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1970s, financial problems plagued the university and threatened its existence. During this later period of the 70s to the early 80s, the university began concentrating its teaching into large departments. Cooperation with local companies was forged, allowing the university to secure vital research contracts. Due to its growing international reputation, the university began to attract a sizable number of International students.[17]\r\n\r\nIn 1987 Martin Harris was appointed Vice-Chancellor, taking over from the founding Vice-Chancellor, Albert Sloman. Also, in this year, University of Essex alumnus Oscar Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nThe 1990s\r\nThe Rab Butler Building\r\n\r\nThe university entered the 1990s with the expansion of its facilities, adding new residential blocks to provide further living space for its student population between 1991 and 1992. The Rab Butler building was opened in 1991 as the headquarters for the British Household Panel Survey. By its 30th anniversary in 1993, the university had built itself up into 17 key departments, providing education and research opportunities for 5,500 students, and employing 1,300 staff and faculty. The university also contained 5 industrial units and housed the Economic and Social Research Council\'s Data Archive. Further expansion continued to take place after 1993, with the £5.5 million expansion scheme for the provision of 234 new apartments for 1,200 students in a new student village.[18]\r\nThe 2000s\r\n\r\nOn 25 November 2004, Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the university as part of its 40th anniversary celebrations (1964–2004). Some of the longest running members of staff were invited to meet them at the presentation including the first student, John M. Dowden. Starting postgraduate research on fluid dynamics at the age of 23 in 1963, John later became a professor of mathematics and was the head of the Mathematics Department from 2001–2005. He retired in September 2008.\r\n\r\nThe university continued to expand. At the Colchester Campus, the Network Centre building opened in May 2004 housing the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering and parts of the Department of Computer Science (who merged in 2007 to create the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering). University Quays, a student accommodation complex housing 770 students, opened in September 2003.\r\nThe Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall\r\n\r\nThe Ivor Crewe Lecture Hall, with a 1,000 seat capacity, opened in 2006.[19][20] The building was designed by the architect Patel Taylor and attracted a mixed response. Prince Charles referred to it as \'like a dustbin\',[21] while the Civic Trust, a charity of which he is patron, awarded it a Civic Trust award (2008) for making \'an outstanding contribution to the quality and appearance of the environment\'.[22] The building was named after Sir Ivor Crewe in April 2007, to mark his retirement from the position of vice chancellor, a position he had held since 1995.[23]\r\n\r\nThe Gateway Building at the Southend Campus was opened in January 2007, providing facilities for Essex Business School, East 15 Acting School and the School of Health and Social Care plus a business incubation centre. The university also converted a former church into the Clifftown Studios to provide East 15 students with a theatre, studios and workshop spaces. This means the university has an operating theatre at each of its three campuses. [24]\r\n\r\nThe Social Science Research Centre was completed in February 2007, housing the Institute for Social and Economic Research and the UK Data Archive.\r\n\r\nA new building for the health and human sciences was opened in 2008, now named the Kimmy Eldridge Building in honour of the late Professor Kimmy Eldridge who joined the university in 1994 to establish the Nursing and Health Studies Unit[25], now part of the School of Health and Social Care.\r\n\r\nThe Centre for Brain Science opened in 2009 providing a new home for the Department of Psychology.\r\n2010 to present\r\nUniversity Square, Southend, student accommodation\r\n\r\nIn Southend, University Square, a 560 bedroom development near to the Gateway building opened in September 2010.\r\n\r\nTony Rich Teaching Centre, built on the site of the former central boiler house, was officially opened on 6 October 2010.\r\n\r\nWivenhoe House, an 18th-century manor house on Wivenhoe Park, closed in December 2009 and reopened in 2012 as a hotel and home of the Edge Hotel School,[26] which is the UK\'s first working hotel school dedicated to the development of future leaders of the hotel and hospitality industry.\r\n\r\nThe Forum Southend-on-Sea opened in 2013 and was a joint project between Essex, Southend-on-Sea Borough Council and South Essex College. The building was a runner-up in the \'Buildings that Inspire\' category of The Guardian University Awards in 2015.[27][28]\r\n\r\nAt the Colchester Campus, a new 540-bedroom student accommodation complex, The Meadows, opened in May 2013.\r\n\r\nThe Essex Business School building opened in 2015, believed to be the UK\'s first zero-carbon business school building, with a winter garden giving the building its own micro-climate and a rainwater pond recycling water to cool the building. The building includes a trading floor with Bloomberg terminals offering direct use of Bloomberg information[29] The building won the RICS Design through Innovation Award for the East of England.[30]\r\nExterior of the STEM Centre building at the University of Essex Colchester campus\r\nThe STEM Centre\r\n\r\nThe Silberrad Student Centre and Albert Sloman Library extension designed by Patel Taylor opened in 2015 providing additional study space and modern IT-rich learning facilities. The project received RIBA\'s Regional Building of the Year Award 2016 plus a national RIBA awards.[31]\r\n\r\nIn 2018, a new £12m STEM Centre opened to house the university\'s science departments[32] and The Copse student accommodation opened offering 643 new single ensuite rooms and studios[33].\r\nArchitecture of Colchester Campus\r\n\r\nThe main campus, Wivenhoe Park, was once painted by famous landscape painter John Constable. Wivenhoe Park houses the main 1960s buildings along with Wivenhoe House, an 18th-century mansion that also features in Constable\'s painting. Wivenhoe House hotel was closed in December 2010 for major refurbishment and reopened in 2012 as a combined four-star country house hotel and hotel school.[34] The Edge Hotel School was originally a partnership between the university and the Edge Foundation and is now a department of the university.\r\n\r\nWith its concrete architecture, the University is typical of England\'s 1960s universities. The architect of the campus, Kenneth Capon, took the Tuscan town of San Gimignano with its squares and towers as an inspiration (the university has six residential towers mainly for undergraduates, but the original plan was to build 29). As well as the towers, South Courts, The Houses, The Meadows and the University Quays residences provide enough space to guarantee every first year a place on campus as well as all overseas students. Due to its particular form of architecture involving the use of prefabricated concrete and glass, the university is referred to as a Plate Glass university.\r\n\r\nThere are two small lakes on the Colchester Campus (in the middle of one is the Vice-Chancellor\'s house which was built at the same time as the university.\r\n\r\nThe library has one of the few remaining still operating continuous loop paternoster lifts in the country.\r\nExterior of the Essex Business School building\r\nEssex Business School\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganization\r\nThe Psychology building\r\n\r\nThe university is organised into three faculties, comprising 20 schools and departments, spanning the Humanities, Social Sciences and Science and Health.\r\n;Faculty of Humanities\r\n\r\n    Department of History\r\n    Department of Literature, Film, and Theatre Studies\r\n    East 15 Acting School\r\n    Edge Hotel School\r\n    Essex Pathways\r\n    School of Philosophy and Art History\r\n    School of Law\r\n\r\nFaculty of Science and Health\r\n\r\n    School of Biological Sciences\r\n    School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering\r\n    School of Health and Social Care\r\n    Department of Mathematical Sciences\r\n    Department of Psychology\r\n    School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Science\r\n\r\nFaculty of Social Sciences\r\n\r\n    Department of Economics\r\n    Department of Government\r\n    Department of Language and Linguistics\r\n    Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies\r\n    Department of Sociology\r\n    Essex Business School\r\n    Institute for Social and Economic Research\r\n    UK Data Archive\r\n\r\n[35]\r\nInstitute for Social and Economic Research\r\n\r\nThe Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) is a research centre for the analysis of panel data in Economics and Sociology. It opened in 1989 as the ESRC Research Centre on Micro-Social Change in Britain and now houses the ESRC-funded Understanding Society[36] project, a longitudinal study of the socio-economic circumstances and attitudes of 100,000 individuals in 40,000 British households.\r\nEast 15 Acting School\r\n\r\nIn September 2000 the East 15 Acting School became part of the university. The school is based in Loughton in southwest Essex and has a branch in Southend.\r\nSchool of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering\r\n\r\nThe School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering was inaugurated on 1 August 2007. It was created by merging two long-established departments: The Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering which both began in 1966.[37]\r\n\r\nIt has particular strengths in Robotics, Telecommunications, Artificial Intelligence and Logic and Computation. In 1999 a robotic football team from the department came third in the RoboCup 99 - part of the Robot Wars (TV series). Essex has a long tradition in Artificial Intelligence research. According to a report to UK Parliament, UK\'s AI research started in the 1950s and 1960s when the four major AI research centres at universities of Edinburgh, Sussex, Essex, and Cambridge were formed.[38]\r\n\r\nCurrent academics include Richard Bartle, best known as co-creator of MUD1.[39] Emeritus professors include Edward Tsang. known for his work on constraint satisfaction and computational finance, and Ray Turner, best known for his numerous publications relating to Logic and Computation.[40] A former academic, Charles George Broyden, a senior lecturer in the department from 1967–1970, independently discovered the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method. It has been a key technique in solving optimization problems, while he was also well known for Broyden\'s methods and Broyden family methods.[41] In 2009, the Charles Broyden Prize was named after him to \"honor this remarkable researcher\" by Optimization Methods and Software in the international optimization community.[42]\r\n\r\nIn the Research Assessment Exercise 2014, 71% of Essex\'s submission in the Computer Science and Informatics unit of assessment was rated as level 4 - world leading - or level 3 - internationally excellent.[43]In 2014, Essex\'s computer science was ranked among the best 101-150 computer science programs in the world (joint 8th in UK) according to ARWU.[44]\r\nPartnerships\r\n\r\nThe university has stated it is prioritising new and existing partnerships at international and national level[45].\r\n\r\nThe university has a number of international academic partnerships[46] offering a range of dual degrees, double degrees and masters with universities in China, France, Germany, Japan, Russia and Singapore. This includes a double degree with Northwest University approved by the Ministry of Education in China[47]. Essex also has link and friendship agreements plus progression arrangements with more than 100 higher education institutions around the world. Essex offers a range of degree courses in partnership with Kaplan Singapore.[48]\r\n\r\nEssex also delivers postgraduate training in partnership with the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in London. partnership with Kaplan Open Learning offers online degrees through the University of Essex Online.\r\n\r\nUniversity of Essex International College is a partnership between Kaplan International Pathways and the university offering degree preparation courses for international students at the Colchester Campus[49].\r\n\r\nThe partnerships with Writtle University College near Chelmsford [50] and the University of Suffolk now only cover students who commenced their studies prior to 2016-17 since both institutions have now been awarded university status.[51][52] The University of Suffolk, formally known as University Campus Suffolk, was originally established as a joint venture with the University of East Anglia, with a central campus in Ipswich and five centres in Suffolk and Norfolk. From 2020 there will be no further enrolments to Essex awards at University Centre Colchester at Colchester Institute[53] and the partnership arrangement with South Essex College in Southend is also being phased out.\r\nReputation\r\nThe Tony Rich Teaching Centre, opened in 2010\r\n\r\nOn two occasions Essex has been awarded the Queen\'s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education, in 2009 for its \"advancing the legal and broader practice of international human rights,\" and in 2017 for its \"authoritative social and economic research to inform the policies of governments for the improvement of people’s lives.\"[54][55]\r\n\r\nFor many years Essex was among the smallest multi-faculty universities in Britain but its strategic plan 2013-19 set a target of expanding by around 50% to around 15,000 students[56].\r\n\r\nIt was a member of the 1994 Group. It is now a member of the Young European Research Universities Network (YERUN) and Young Universities for the Future of Europe (YUFE) alliance[57].\r\n\r\nEssex has developed an international reputation for teaching and research. The annual Summer School in Social Science Data Analysis and Collection, celebrated its 50th year in 2017,[58] more than 15,000 faculty and students from all over the world have completed courses through the Summer School over the past five decades.[59] The Human Rights Centre at Essex was established in 1982. One of the first academic centres of its kind in the world, the work of the Human Rights Centre led to the university receiving a Queen\'s Anniversary Prize in 2010 for its work to promote human rights internationally.[60]\r\n\r\nThe University of Essex was rated in the top 20 in the UK in the Research Excellence Framework (REF 2014)[61] and has been in the top 15 for overall student satisfaction for five years running, amongst mainstream English universities, according to the National Student Survey (NSS, 2017).[62]\r\n\r\nThe 1987 Novel Peace Prize was awarded to Óscar Arias who completed his doctorate in Political Science in 1973. The 2010 Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Christopher Pissarides who gained his BA and MA degrees in Economics in the early 1970s. In 2016 former Essex academic Oliver Hart won the Nobel Prize for Economics.[63]Derek Walcott, who received the 1992 Novel Prize in Literature, served as Professor of Poetry at the university from 2010 to 2013 before his retirement.\r\nRankings\r\nRankingsNational rankings\r\nComplete (2019)[64]	26\r\nGuardian (2019)[65]	31\r\nTimes / Sunday Times (2019)[66]	29\r\nGlobal rankings\r\nARWU (2018)[67]	501–600\r\nQS (2019)[68]\r\n	355=\r\nTHE (2019)[69]	251–300\r\nBritish Government assessment\r\nTeaching Excellence Framework[70]	Gold\r\n\r\nNationally, Essex was ranked 22nd overall in The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide 2018 and was shortlisted for its University of the Year Award in the same year.[71]\r\n\r\nEssex was rated Gold in the Teaching Excellence Framework in 2017. The TEF Panel noted students from all backgrounds achieved outstanding outcomes with regards to continuation and progression to highly skilled employment or further study and outstanding levels of satisfaction with teaching, academic support, and assessment and feedback.[72]\r\n\r\nEssex has been consistently ranked first for politics research and was once again ranked top in the Research Excellence Framework 2014 (REF2014) for politics and international studies.[73] Essex was 19th overall, out of mainstream UK universities, according to the Times Higher Education\'s \'intensity\' ranking for REF2014 which mapped university performance against the proportion of eligible staff submitted.[74] Nine Essex subjects were ranked in the top 25 in the UK using this \'intensity\' measure including sociology, economics, business and management, art history, philosophy, law, history and sport and exercise sciences.[61]\r\n\r\nThe university is ranked 251st-300th in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2018[75] and 352nd in the QS World University Rankings 2018.[76]\r\n\r\nEssex is ranked in the top 50 for both the social sciences and law in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2018. Essex is also ranked 126th-150th for Business and Economics, 201st-250th for Arts and Humanities, and 175th-200th for Computer Science in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[77] In the QS World University Rankings by Subject, Essex is ranked 36th for politics, 37th for sociology, 101st-150th for economics and econometrics, 101st-150th for linguistics, 151st-200th for English language and literature and 151st-200th for law and legal studies.[78]\r\n\r\nAccording to the Times Higher Education 100 Under 50 rankings published in 2014, the university was placed 22nd, up seven places from the previous year.[79]\r\n\r\nIn 2018, it was ranked in the top 15 for overall student satisfaction out of English mainstream universities (defined by the university as non-specialist higher education institutions with a survey population of at least 500) for the sixth year running in the National Student Survey.[80]\r\nRegius professorship\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Queen Elizabeth II conferred upon the university the Regius Professorship, recognizing \"50 years of excellence in research and education in political science at Essex.\"[81] The first Regius professor was David Sanders of the Government Department, who held the post from 2014–2017.[82] In December 2017 Kristian Skrede Gleditsch was appointed as the second Regius Professor.[83]\r\nCriticism\r\n\r\nIn her article \"Diary: Why I Quit\" in the London Review of Books,[84] the novelist and the chair of judges for the 2015 Man Booker International Prize Dame Marina Warner compared the University of Essex to \"the world of Chinese communist corporatism where enforcers rush to carry out the latest orders from their chiefs in an ecstasy of obedience to ideological principles which they do not seem to have examined, let alone discussed with the people they order to follow them, whom they cashier when they won’t knuckle under.\" And in \"The Strange Death of the Liberal University\",[85] Michael Bailey describes the university as a place that promotes \"divisive competition, false economies and philistine instrumentality\".\r\nStudent life\r\nStudent body\r\n\r\nThe university has a very large population of international students, with over 5,000 international students in 2015.[86] Nearly 50% of postgraduates and 40% of undergraduates are students whose country of origin is outside of the UK (including EU). The university boasts a large proportion of local students from state schools, and a third of its undergraduates are from working-class homes.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nEssex has an international character with 132 countries represented in its student body. The Times Higher Education World Rankings placed Essex joint 15th for the highest percentage of international students with 44.3% of students coming from outside the UK.[87] Essex is also in the top 20 for \'international outlook\' in these rankings[88] - this indicator measures the proportion of staff and students from outside the UK alongside international collaboration on research.\r\nStudents\' Union\r\nStudents\' Union across Square 3\r\n\r\nThe University of Essex Students\' Union is well regarded nationally with awards including: officially recognised as a leading Students’ Union by the Students’ Union Evaluation Initiative, awarded Investors In People status as a good employer, winner of Sound Impact Environmental Award for ethical and environmental performance, Sub Zero was voted ‘Best Student Venue in the UK’ at the Smirnoff BEDA Awards. Some of the major music bands to play in Sub Zero include AC/DC, Blur, Iggy Pop, The Kinks, Can, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, The Smiths and The Specials.[89]\r\n\r\nThe Students\' Union runs the majority of commercial services on campus. Its shops stock imported food products, reflecting the university\'s international community. It has licensed venues including the SU bar and club-style venues: Frango\'s, Base, Top Bar, and Sub Zero (formerly the Underground and before that the Dancehall), which have hosted many bands and DJs. Sub Zero was voted best student union venue upon its refurbishment and is one of the biggest in the country, with a capacity of over 1,200. The Students\' Union Bar underwent a £400,000 refurbishment in the summer of 2010.\r\n\r\nThe Students Union employs about 380 student staff and 50 permanent staff to work in its shops, venues, etc. The University of Essex Students Union was the first SU in the UK to receive the \'Investors in people Gold\' award in late 2009.[90]\r\n\r\nThe Students\' Union underwent reform in 2007-8, in which the trustee and executive functions were separated, and greater voice was given to satellite campuses. The Executive Committee is composed of seven full-time officers and ten part-time officers. In 2016, students tried to change the constitution in order to introduce an 11th part-time officer, the working class officer.[91] This referendum failed by 3 votes. Essex students have voted to leave the National Union of Students in an All Student Vote which took place in 2017. A total of 1026 votes were cast across the three campuses (845 Colchester, 132 in Southend and 46 in Loughton) with 59% in favour of disaffiliating from the national body.[92] In 2018, the student body voted to change the way the Students\' Union in a referendum where there is a Student Parliament that represents students and holds the officers accountable.[93][94]\r\n\r\nThe Students\' Union newspaper and radio, is called Rebel.\r\nSport\r\n\r\nStudent sports teams are known as the Essex Blades and there are 40 clubs covering a range of sports including football, rugby union, netball and cricket, as well as in non-traditional sports such as korfball, ultimate frisbee, pole dancing and cheerleading.[95]\r\n\r\nEssex invests significantly in three \'focus sports\', volleyball, basketball and rugby sevens. National successes in these sports include winning the men’s team winning the Volleyball England National Student Cup in 2017[96] and the women’s basketball team winning the Basketball England National Cup in 2016.[97] The men’s basketball team won the Basketball England National League Division 4 and the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) National Trophy in 2017.[98]\r\n\r\nIn January 2018, the university was due to open the Essex Sport Arena at the Colchester Campus, an international-standard sporting venue with seating for 1,650 spectators. It will provide facilities for basketball, volleyball, futsal, table tennis, and badminton, and will also host the Max Whitlock Gymnastics School.[99][needs update]\r\n\r\nA number of National Governing Bodies have partnerships with the university including the Football Association, England Rugby, the Lawn Tennis Association, Basketball England, and Volleyball England. Essex is also a \"Sport England Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme Delivery Centre\". Great Britain and England teams use the university’s sporting facilities for training camps, and the facilities also play host to a wide range of sporting competitions such as county and regional championships.[100]\r\n\r\nThe Colchester Campus is also home to one of the longest-established disc golf courses in the UK which has hosted many international championships including the World Team Disc Golf Championship in 2017.[101]\r\n\r\nOnce a year, \'Derby Day\' is a sports contest between the University of Essex clubs and the University of East Anglia sport teams. The event is hosted alternately by Essex and UEA'),

(4, 23, 'The University of Hong Kong', 'The University of Hong Kong (HKU) is a public research university in Hong Kong. Founded in 1911, its origins trace back to the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, which was founded in 1887. It is the oldest tertiary institution in Hong Kong.[5]\r\n\r\nAs of 2019, HKU ranks second in Asia by QS and fourth by THE, and around top 30 internationally.[6][7][8][9] It has been commonly regarded as one of the most internationalized universities in the world as well as one of the most prestigious universities in Asia.[10] Today, HKU has ten academic faculties with English as the main language of instruction. HKU also ranks highly in the sciences, dentistry, biomedicine,[11] education,[12] humanities, law,[13] economics, business administration,[14] linguistics,[15] political science,[16][17] and the social sciences\r\n\r\nFounding\r\nThe Main Building in 1912.\r\n\r\nThe origins of the University of Hong Kong can be traced back to the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese founded in 1887 (renamed the Hong Kong College of Medicine in 1907). The college became HKU\'s medical school in 1911.\r\n\r\nThe University of Hong Kong was founded in 1911. Governor Sir Frederick Lugard had proposed to establish a university in Hong Kong to compete with the other Great Powers opening universities in China, most notably Prussia, which had just opened the Tongji German Medical School in Shanghai.[19] Sir Hormusjee Naorojee Mody, an Indian businessman in Hong Kong, learned of Lugard\'s plan and pledged to donate HK$150,000 towards the construction and HK$30,000 towards other costs.[20] The Hong Kong Government and the business sector in southern China, which were both equally eager to learn \"secrets of the West\'s success\" (referring to technological advances made since the Industrial Revolution), also gave their support. The Government contributed a site at West Point. Swire Group contributed £40,000 to endow a chair in Engineering, in addition to thousands of dollars in equipment (its aim was partly to bolster its corporate image following the death of a passenger on board one of its ships, Fatshan, and the subsequent unrest stirred by the Self-Government Society).[21] Along with donations from other donors including the British Government and companies such as HSBC, Lugard finally had enough to fund the building of the university.\r\n\r\nCharles Eliot was appointed HKU\'s first Vice-Chancellor.[20] As Governor of Hong Kong, Lugard laid the foundation stone of the Main Building on 16 March 1910 and hoped that the university would educate more Chinese people in British \"imperial values\", as opposed to those of other Western powers.[citation needed] The university was incorporated in Hong Kong as a self-governing body of scholars on 30 March 1911 and had its official opening ceremony on 11 March 1912. It was founded as an all-male institution; women students were admitted for the first time ten years later.[5]\r\n\r\nAs Lugard felt that the Chinese society at the time was not suited to ideals such as communism, the university originally emulated the University of Manchester in emphasising the sciences over the humanities.[citation needed] It opened with three founding faculties, Arts, Engineering and Medicine.[5][22] The Faculty of Medicine was founded as the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese by the London Missionary Society in 1887.[23] Of the College\'s early alumni, the most renowned was Sun Yat-sen,[5] who led the Chinese Revolution of 1911 which changed China from an empire to a republic. In December 1916, the university held its first convocation, with 23 graduates and five honorary graduates.\r\nMove towards Chinese cultural education, and WW2\r\nMain Building in 1946, with visible damage from the Second World War.\r\n\r\nAfter the Canton-Hong Kong strikes of 1925 and 1926, the government moved towards greater integration of Eastern culture, increasing the number of Chinese courses.[24] In 1927, a degree in Chinese was created. Donations from wealthy businessmen Tang Chi Ngong and Fung Ping Shan – after whom two campus buildings are named – triggered an emphasis on Chinese cultural education. In 1937, the Queen Mary Hospital opened. It has served as the university\'s teaching hospital ever since. In 1941, the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong caused damage to university buildings, and the university closed until 1945, during this period, the Medical College of the University of Hong Kong moved to Chengdu to run a school.\r\n1945 to 2001\r\n\r\nAfter the end of the Second World War, the university reopened and investment in law and the social sciences increased as post-war reconstruction efforts began in earnest. The Faculty of Social Sciences was established in 1967 and the Department of Law in 1969. The student population in 1961 was 2,000, quadrupled from 1941.\r\n\r\nIn 1982, the Faculty of Dentistry, based at the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, was established. To this day, it remains Hong Kong\'s only faculty training dental professionals. In 1984, both the School of Architecture and School of Education became fully-fledged faculties and in the same year the Faculty of Law was created. The Faculty of Business and Economics was established in 2001 as the university\'s tenth and youngest faculty.\r\n\r\nAfter 1989, the Hong Kong government began to emphasise local tertiary education in order to retain local students who would otherwise have studied abroad in the United Kingdom. Student places and course variety were greatly increased in preparation for the handover of Hong Kong. By 2001, the number of students had grown to 14,300 and the number of degree courses to over a hundred.\r\n2001 to present\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Growing with Hong Kong: HKU and its Graduates – The First 90 Years was published by the Hong Kong University Press as a study of the impact of HKU\'s graduates on Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nIn January 2006, despite protest from a portion of students and alumni, the Faculty of Medicine was renamed as the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine \"as a recognition of the generosity\" of Li Ka Shing and his foundation, which pledged HK$1 billion in support of the university\'s \"general development as well as research and academic activities in medicine\".[citation needed]\r\n\r\nOn 16 August 2011, Li Keqiang, Vice Premier of the People\'s Republic of China, began a three-day visit to promote development between Hong Kong and mainland China.[25][26] The university was locked down. The mishandling by the police force caused the Hong Kong 818 incident.[27] In a statement to the HKU community, the university vice-chancellor Professor Lap-chee Tsui admitted that the security arrangements could have been better planned and organised, and apologised to students and alumni for not having been able to prevent the incident. He assured them that \"the University campus belongs to students and teachers, and that it will always remain a place for freedom of expression\".[28] On 30 August 2011, the university council resolved to set up a panel to review issues arising from the vice premier\'s visit, to improve arrangements and to set up policies for future university events that are consistent with its commitment to freedom of expression.\r\n\r\nFrom 2010 to 2012, the university celebrated its 100th anniversary and the opening of the Centennial Campus at the western end of the university site in Pokfulam.[29] The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital (also known as Binhai Hospital), which is operated by the university, also opened in 2011.[30][31]\r\n\r\nOn 10 April 2015, HKU declared itself as the first university in the world to join HeForShe, a UN initiative urging men to achieve more female rights.[32] The university promised that it would triple the number of female dean-level members by 2020, so that more than 1 out of 5 deans would be women.[33]\r\n\r\nOn 15 December 2017, the university\'s governing council appointed UC Berkeley nanoscience professor Xiang Zhang to the posts of President and Vice-Chancellor with effect from January 2018. Zhang was the first vice-chancellor of the university born in mainland China and educated to undergraduate degree level there.[34][35]\r\n2015 political interference\r\nMain article: HKU pro-vice-chancellor selection controversy\r\n\r\nThe HKU Council made headlines in 2015 for alleged political interference behind the selection process for a new pro-vice chancellor. A selection committee unanimously recommended the council appoint Johannes Chan to the post, which involved the responsibility for staffing and resources, and which had been left vacant for five years.[36] Chan, the former dean of the Faculty of Law, was a distinguished scholar in constitutional law and human rights and \"a vocal critic on Hong Kong’s political reform issues\".[37][38] Owing to his liberal political stance, Chan was roundly criticised by Communist Party-controlled media including Wen Wei Po, Ta Kung Pao, and Global Times, which together published at least 350 articles attacking him.[36][39][40][41]\r\n\r\nCustomarily the HKU Council accepts the recommendations of search committees for senior posts, with no prior recommendation having been rejected by the council.[37][42][43] The council was criticised when it delayed the decision to appoint Chan, stating that it should wait until a new provost was in place. Finally, in September 2015, the council rejected Chan\'s appointment (12 votes to eight) through an anonymous vote in a closed meeting, providing no reason for the decision.[36] Political interference was widely suspected and the opacity of the council criticised.[42]\r\n\r\nThe decision is seen widely viewed as a pro-government act of retaliation against \"pro-democracy leaders and participants\" and a blow to academic freedom.[37][42] Six members of the council are directly appointed by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, who acts as chancellor of all publicly funded tertiary institutions in the territory.[44] Five members are delegates to the National People’s Congress in Beijing and, as such, are obliged to toe the Communist Party line or risk expulsion.[45] In overall Council makeup, university students and staff are outnumbered by members from outside the university.[45]\r\n\r\nThe decision was decried by student groups including the Hong Kong University Students’ Union and Hong Kong Federation of Students, faculty members, leading international law scholars, and legislators.[36][45][45][46][47] They noted that the decision would serve as a warning to other academics not to engage in pro-democratic politics and would severely tarnish Hong Kong\'s reputation for academic freedom and education excellence.[43][47] The law faculty also refuted the allegations against Chan.[48][49] Billy Fung, student union president, revealed details of the discussion to the public and was subsequently expelled from the council.[50]\r\nCampus\r\nEliot Hall and Meng Wah Complex\r\nT.T. Tsui Building\r\nThe Kadoorie Biological Sciences Building and the Pillar of Shame.\r\n\r\nThe university\'s main campus covers 160,000 square metres of land on Pokfulam Road and Bonham Road in Lung Fu Shan of Hong Kong Island. The university also has a few buildings in Sandy Bay Gap. HKU buildings are some of the few remaining examples of British Colonial architecture in Hong Kong. The university lends its name to HKU Station, the main public transport access to the campus opened in 2014.\r\n\r\nThe Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine is situated 4.5 km southwest of the main campus, in the Southern District near Sandy Bay and Pokfulam. The medical campus includes Queen Mary Hospital, the William M.W. Mong Building and research facilities. The Faculty of Dentistry is situated in the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, Sai Ying Pun.\r\n\r\nThe university also operates the Kadoorie Agricultural Research Centre, which occupies 95,000 square metres of land in the New Territories, and the Swire Institute of Marine Science at the southern tip of the d\'Aguilar Peninsula on Hong Kong Island.\r\nMain building\r\nMain Building\r\nMain Building corridor\r\n\r\nConstructed between 1910 and 1912, the Main Building is the university\'s oldest structure and was sponsored by Sir Hormusjee Naorojee Mody and designed by Architect Messrs Leigh & Orange.[51] It is built in the post-renaissance style with red brick and granite and has two courtyards. The main elevation is articulated by four turrets with a central clock tower (a gift from Sir Paul Chater in 1930). The two courtyards were added in the south in 1952 and one floor in the end block in 1958. The building was originally used as classrooms and laboratories for the Faculty of Medicine and Engineering and was later the home of departments within the Faculty of Arts. The central Great Hall (Loke Yew Hall) is named after Loke Yew, a Malayan benefactor of the university in its early years. It became a declared monument in 1984.[52]\r\nSwire building\r\n\r\nIn around 1980, the Swire Group sponsored the building of a new residential hall in the eastern end of the campus. Because of the sponsorship, the new student residence was named Swire Building. The building was officially opened by Mr. John Anthony Swire CBE on 11 November 1980. In 1983, the colour orange was chosen to be the hall colour in the second Annual General Meeting since the colour was used as the background colour during the first open day of Swire Hall and no other halls were using orange as their hall colour.\r\n\r\nIn 1983, Mrs. J. Lau (Director of Centre Media Resources) provided a design for the hall logo. The Swire Hall Students\' Association, HKUSU, then made some amendments to that design. The logo shows the words \'S\' and \'H\'. The design of the word \'S\' looks like two hands holding each other, signifying that all hall-mates should co-operate with each other, and promoting the hall motto \'Unity and Sincerity\'.\r\nHung Hing Ying Building\r\n\r\nFinanced by Sir Paul Chater, Professor G. P. Jordan and others, it was opened in 1919 by the Governor of Hong Kong Sir Reginald Stubbs and housed the students\' union. After World War II, the building was used temporarily for administrative purposes. The East Wing was added in 1960. The building was converted into the Senior Common Room in 1974. It was named in honour of Mr Hung Hing Ying in 1986 for his family\'s donations to the university. The building was subsequently used again for administrative purposes, and housed Department of Music until early 2013. It is currently used by the Development & Alumni Affairs Office. The two-storey Edwardian style structure is characterised by a central dome and the use of red brick to emulate the Main Building opposite. The building became a declared monument in 1995.\r\nTang Chi Ngong Building\r\n\r\nThe idea to establish a school of Chinese was proposed in the inter-war period. Construction of the premises began in 1929 following a donation from Tang Chi-ngong, father of the philanthropist Sir Tang Shiu-kin, after whom the building was named. It was opened by Sir William Peel, Governor of Hong Kong, in 1931 and since then further donations have been received for the endowment of teaching Chinese language and literature. The building has been used for other purposes since the 1970s but the name remained unchanged. At present, it houses the Centre of Asian Studies. This three-storey flat-roofed structure is surfaced with Shanghai plaster and became a declared monument in 1995.\r\nCentennial campus\r\n\r\nTo provide additional space for students under the new four-year undergraduate curriculum the Centennial Campus was built at the western end of the main campus, which was previously occupied by the Water Supplies Department.[53] The construction of the campus started in late 2009, and was completed in 2012, the first year of the introduction of the new academic structure in Hong Kong. In 2012, the Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Social Sciences moved to the Centennial Campus.\r\nAcademics\r\nAdmission\r\n\r\nAdmission to HKU is highly competitive. In 2012, the university received over 70,946 applications for undergraduate studies, 23,852 of which were from outside the Hong Kong schools\' system.[54] For international applicants, the enrolment rate was about 1 student for every 12 applications, compared with 1 out of every 10 applicants for local non-JUPAS admissions, while the enrolment rate for Mainland China applicants was 1 student for every 31 applications.[54][55][56] According to a survey done by the Education18.com (The Hong Kong Education Net), HKU enrolled students with the best performance in HKDSE examination in 2012.[57] Internationally, applicants with more than 5 A*s in their GCE A-Levels, 75/75 in the Taiwan GSAT, 45/45 in IB, and 16 5** Zhuangyuan (??) (the top Gaokao scoring students in their province or city in mainland China) are amongst those matriculated into the University.[58] The latest Global Admissions Profile, with information and data about last year\'s admission and current international opportunities for those admitted, and the International Admissions Brochure, with information about applications for admission, are available on the HKU website.[59]\r\n\r\nUndergraduate candidates are selected according to their relative merit in the local public examination (HKDSEE) and apply online via JUPAS. Other applicants, including overseas students or ones taking other examinations, are classified as non-JUPAS applicants who are required to apply via the official website,[60] where postgraduate applications may also be made.[60]\r\nTeaching and learning\r\n\r\nMost undergraduate courses are 4-year degrees while the medical and nursing programmes require two and one more year(s) of studies respectively. English is the main medium of instruction, and the University\'s Senate has endorsed English as the campus lingua franca. Starting from 2012, local students are required to take Academic English courses and Chinese language enhancement courses; however, students who are native-speakers of languages other than Chinese, and students who have not studied Chinese language in their secondary curriculum can be exempted from the Chinese course requirement.[61] Cantonese credit-courses for Mainland Chinese and Taiwan students, and ab initio Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese credit-courses for international and exchange students are offered by the Chinese Language Centre, School of Chinese.\r\nResearch\r\n\r\nThe university is a founding member of Universitas 21, an international consortium of research-led universities, and a member of the Association for Pacific Rim Universities, the Association of Commonwealth Universities and many others. HKU benefits from a large operating budget supplied by high levels of government funding compared to many Western countries. In 2012/13, the Research Grants Council (RGC) granted The University of Hong Kong a total research funding of HK$1,088 million, which is the highest among all universities in Hong Kong.[62] HKU professors were among the highest paid in the world as well, having salaries far exceeding those of their US counterparts in private universities. However, with the reduction of salaries in recent years, this is no longer the case.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nHKU research output, researchers, projects, patents and theses are profiled and made publicly available in the HKU Scholars Hub.[63] 100 members of academic staff (>10% of professoriate staff) from HKU are ranked among the world\'s top 1% of scientists by the Thomson Reuters\' Essential Science Indicators, by means of the citations recorded on their publications.[64] The university has the largest number of research postgraduate students in Hong Kong, making up approximately 10% of the total student population. All ten faculties and departments provide teaching and supervision for research (MPhil and PhD) students with administration undertaken by the Graduate School.\r\nLibraries and museums\r\nMain article: University Museum and Art Gallery\r\nThe University Museum and Art Gallery from Bonham Road.\r\n\r\nHKU Libraries (HKUL) was established in 1912, being the oldest academic library in Hong Kong with over 2.3 million current holdings. It comprises the Main Library and six specialist branch libraries: the Dental, Education, Fung Ping Shan (East Asian Language), Yu Chun Keung Medical, Lui Che Woo Law, and Music libraries. They are located in buildings around the campus with varying opening hours. A web-based library catalogue, DRAGON, allows one to search HKUL\'s books, journals and other resources.[65]\r\n\r\nThe HKUL Digital Initiatives, through its digitisation projects, has opened up online access to local collections originally in print format. The first HKUL Digital Initiative, ExamBase, was launched in 1996 and other projects of scholarly interests were introduced. More digital projects are being developed to provide continuous access to digital content and services. It provides open access to Chinese and English academic and medical periodicals published in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nThe three-storey Fung Ping Shan Building was erected in 1932 originally as a library for Chinese books. Named after its donor, the building consists of masonry on the ground level surmounted by a two-storey red-brick structure with ornamental columns topped by a pediment over its entrance. Since 1962, the Chinese books collection, now known as the Fung Ping Shan Library, was transferred to the university\'s Main Library and the whole building was converted into a museum for Chinese art and archaeology. Among its collections are ceramics, pottery and bronze sculptures. In 1996, the lowest three floors of the new Tsui Building were added to the old building to form the University Museum and Art Gallery.\r\nReputation and rankings\r\n\r\nHKU admits the highest number of top scorers from the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examinations.

It offers more than a hundred clubs and associations for students. This organisation is renowned amongst student activists, having been the main driving force behind evicting a chancellor in recent years. There was controversy when the head of the union, Ayo Chan, said that some of the protesters involved in the Tiananmen Square massacre had acted irrationally.[85] Many students thought his remarks were offensive and he was ousted by a vote in under one week. The Postgraduate Students Association represents the university\'s postgraduate students.\r\nStudy abroad programme\r\n\r\nThrough the Exchange Buddy Program, students from abroad can choose to be matched with local students whom they can correspond with before they arrive in Hong Kong. These local students greet the visiting students upon arrival at the airport, help them to settle into student residence and offer advice and support during their stay.[86]\r\n\r\nEvery year, over 1,000 undergraduates participate in exchange programmes. As part of their HKU degree, they study at universities spanning 40 countries around the world with the support of the University Grants Committee, University of Hong Kong Foundation for Educational Development and Research, Hongkong Bank Foundation, UBC Alumni Association (Hong Kong), Dr. Lee Shiu Scholarships for Hong Kong and South-East Asia Academic Exchange, Shell (Hong Kong) Limited, C. V. Starr Scholarship Fund, and others.[87] The university welcomes a similar number of students from those 340 partner universities onto the HKU campus to study each year.\r\nOrganisation and administration\r\nGovernance\r\nHKU SPACE Admiralty Learning Centre\r\n\r\nPrior to Hong Kong\'s handover, the colony\'s Governor was the de jure chancellor of the University. That role was assumed by the city\'s Chief Executive following the handover.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Executive\'s role as the university\'s Chancellor is enshrined in the University of Hong Kong Ordinance.[88]\r\n\r\nFor a list of pre and post-handover university chancellors, refer to the articles for the Governor of Hong Kong and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong.\r\nThe Court\r\n\r\nThe Court is a large overseeing and legislative body comprising University and lay members. The purpose of the Court is to represent the wider interests of the communities served by the University. It has the power to make, repeal and amend statutes.\r\nThe Senate\r\n\r\nThe Senate is the principal academic authority of the University. It is responsible for all academic matters and welfare of students. Its 50 members are mainly academic staff while there are also student representatives.\r\nThe Council Membership\r\n\r\nThe Council is the body which governs the university. It is responsible for the management of financial and human resources of the university and for the university’s future developments. The council comprises university members (both staff and students) and lay members (i.e. neither staff nor students of the university), with a ratio of lay to university members of 2:1 members are serving on the council as trustees in their personal capacity.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Executive of Hong Kong has the power to appoint the chairman and six other members of the 24-person council. The vice-chancellor is in turn appointed by the council,[89] although two seats are vacant.\r\n\r\nThe university has ten faculties, namely the Faculties of Architecture, Arts, Business & Economics, Dentistry, Education, Engineering, Law, Science, and Social Sciences, and the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, alongside a graduate school and a number of non-faculty academic units, which provide various study programmes and courses for students.[90] The medium of instruction in most classes is English.[91]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, HKU operates two associate institutions:\r\n\r\n    HKU SPACE (School of Professional and Continuing Education), which was first established as the Department of Extramural Studies in 1956, and later renamed in 1992.[92] It solely awards 2-year Associate Degrees, 2-year Diplomas, Advanced or Higher Diploma Programmes (2-years to 3-years), 1-year Certificates, and individual courses. It also partners with overseas post-secondary institutions, colleges and universities.\r\n    Centennial College, a liberal arts college established in 2012.[93] It has provided self-financed 4-year bachelor\'s degree programmes for HKALE, HKDSE and other graduates from September 2012.\r\n\r\nShield, motto and coat of arms\r\nHKU\'s shield of arms, granted in 1913\r\n\r\nThe design of the university\'s shield of arms was proposed to the College of Arms by the university in October 1912.[94] On 14 May 1913, the shield, along with two mottoes (one in Latin, one in Chinese) was granted by the College of Arms.[94] The field resembles the lions on the coat of arms of England, whereas the book on the shield is a common reference to university\'s role in learning and knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Latin motto Sapientia et Virtus is translated into English as \"Wisdom and Virtue\". The Chinese motto on the pages of the opened book, written from top to bottom, right to left in accordance with traditional Chinese writing direction, contains two phrases: ?? (ming tak) and ?? (kak mat), meaning \"illustrious virtue\" and \"the investigation of things\" respectively. The first phrase ming tak makes homage to the opening sentence of classic Confucian Classical Chinese literature the Great Learning, in which the author discusses the three great duties of a ruler: illustrious virtue, the renewal of the people, and repose in the highest good.[94] The second phrase kak mat is a reference to the writing of Confucian scholar Zhu Xi ????? (lit. exhausting by examination the principles of things and affairs). The phrase occurs in discussion regarding how wise rulers set about cultivating wisdom and virtue. If one desires to rectify their heart, they must first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they must first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things.[94]\r\n\r\nIn 1981, the year of the university\'s 70th anniversary, an application was made to the College of Arms for a full achievement of arms, which was granted in 1984, comprising the original shield and mottoes with the addition of a crest, supporters, a helmet and compartment. The supporters of the coat of arms are a Chinese dragon and a lion representing Britain, indicating the university\'s aspiration to blend East and West cultures, from the foundation by British people in Hong Kong and the later development of the university\'s research and studies in both west and east culture and technology, whereas the compartment is an allusion to Hong Kong Island, where the university is located.

(4, 24, 'Hong Kong University of Science and Tech', 'The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST; Chinese: ??????) is a public research university in Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong. Founded in 1991, it is the territory\'s third institution being granted university status along with establishment.\r\n\r\nHKUST is commonly regarded as one of the fastest growing universities in the world. As of 2019, the university was ranked seventh in Asia by QS and fifth by Times, and around top 40 internationally.[2][3][4][5] It also ranked first in Times Higher Education Young University Rankings in 2018 and second by QS world\'s under-50 universities in 2019.[6][7]\r\n\r\nToday, the university consists of four main academic schools, offering programs in science, engineering, business and management, humanities and social science, along with the Interdisciplinary Programs Office, Fok Ying Tung Graduate School and Institute for Public Policy.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nIn the late 1980s the Hong Kong Government anticipated a strong demand for university graduates to fuel an economy increasingly based on services. Sir Sze-Yuen Chung and Sir Edward Youde, the then Governor of Hong Kong, conceived the idea of another university in addition to the pre-existing two universities, The University of Hong Kong and The Chinese University of Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nPlanning for the \"Third University\", named The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology later, began in 1986. Construction began at the Kohima Camp site in Tai Po Tsai on the Clear Water Bay Peninsula. The site was earmarked for the construction of a new British Army garrison, but plans for the construction of the garrison were shelved after the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed in 1984.\r\nThe Entrance Piazza with the sundial sculpture\r\n\r\nOriginally scheduled to finish in 1994, the death of Sir Edward in 1986 led to increased effort and allowed UST to open its doors early – in 1991. Several leading scientists and researchers took up positions at the new university in its early years, including physicist Leroy Chang who arrived in 1993 as Dean of Science and went on to become Vice-President for Academic Affairs.[9] Thomas E. Stelson was also a founding member of the administration.[10]\r\n\r\nThe project was criticised for surpassing the budget set forth by the Hong Kong Government and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club. However, under the fund-raising efforts of its President, Woo Chia-wei, the first students enrolled in October 1991. By 1992, accommodation and athletic facilities were expanded to support about 7,000 students.\r\n\r\nSeveral more expansion projects such as the construction of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Enterprise Center have since been completed. The library extension building, Lee Shau Kee Business Building (LSK), Lo Ka Chung Building, South Bus Station, Undergraduate Halls VIII and IX, Cheng Yu Tung Building (CYT) and the Conference Lodge, are the latest additions to the campus.\r\nGovernance\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1991 under Chapter 1141 of the Laws of Hong Kong (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Ordinance),[11] HKUST is one of the eight statutory universities in Hong Kong. It is an institution funded by the University Grants Committee (UGC).[12]\r\n\r\nAs with all other statutory universities in Hong Kong, the Chief Executive of HKSAR acts as the Chancellor of HKUST. Prior to the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, this was a ceremonial title bestowed upon the Governor of Hong Kong.\r\nCouncil\r\n\r\nThe supreme governing body of the university is its Council, formed by a total of 27 members. Council members include university administrators, the chairperson of the alumni Convocation, an elected staff member, an elected full-time student representative, as well as 17 \"lay members\" not being employees or students at the university.[13] Under the HKUST Ordinance, The Chief Executive of HKSAR possesses the power of directly appointing the chairman and vice-chairman of the Council, the Treasurer of the University, and not more than 9 of the lay members.\r\nSenate\r\n\r\nThe Senate acts as the university\'s supreme academic body, responsible for making and reviewing the academic policies of the university. It is composed mostly of academic staff members but also includes the Students\' Union president, an elected representative of the undergraduates as well as an elected representative of the postgraduates.[14]\r\nCourt\r\n\r\nBeing the supreme advisory body of the university, the Court is responsible for promoting the university\'s interests and to raise funds.[14]\r\nCampus\r\nBird\'s-eye view of the HKUST campus\r\n\r\nThe university is largely a campus university, occupying a 60-hectare site at the northern part of Clear Water Bay Peninsula in Sai Kung District, New Territories, Hong Kong, overlooking Port Shelter in Tai Po Tsai. The campus layout and architecture is based on a master plan submitted jointly by Simon Kwan & Associates and Percy Thomas Partnership, the runner-up entry in an architectural competition held before the university was founded.\r\n\r\nAs the campus has a sloped terrain, buildings and facilities are built on separate terraces carved out of the hillside, with the academic facilities occupying the top-level terraces, and undergraduate halls of residence and sporting facilities at the seafront. The terraces are connected by motor roads as well as a network of footbridges and elevators known as Bridge Link.\r\n\r\nThe countryside setting of the university contributed to the fact that HKUST was once the only public university in Hong Kong not being directly served by an MTR station, prior to the re-titling of the Education University of Hong Kong. The university is connected to the metro network through public bus routes including 91, 91M and 792M, complemented by a handful of minibus services, with Choi Hung and Hang Hau stations being the major feeder points.[15][16]\r\nAcademic complexes\r\n\r\nAcademic activities are mainly conducted in the Academic Building, which contains 10 lecture theatres (A-H, J-K), a multitude of classrooms, laboratories and administrative offices. The lecture theatres can accommodate classes of up to 450 students and offer audiovisual equipment. In addition, an information center and a souvenir shop can be found at the Piazza.\r\nLee Shau Kee Business Building houses the HKUST Business School\r\n\r\nPrior to 2013, offices and classrooms of all of the four schools were grouped under the same roof in the Academic Building. With the completion of the Lee Shau Kee Business Building (LSK) in 2013, most facilities for the School of Business and Management have relocated from the Academic Building. Opened in 2015, the Cheng Yu Tung Building (CYT) afforded the other schools with additional classrooms and laboratories.\r\n\r\nLocated at the southern tip of the campus, the Lo Ka Chung Building houses the HKUST Jockey Club Institute of Advanced Study (IAS). The adjacent Conference Lodge, managed by the hotel-operating arm of Chinachem Group offers on-campus accommodations for conference attendees and official guests of the university.\r\nStudent and staff housing\r\nMain article: § Students\' residence\r\n\r\nA total of nine undergraduate halls are located at the seafront and mid-rise terraces of the university campus. Also, the university provides 404 Senior Staff Quarters flats and 40 University Apartments flats to its eligible senior staff.[17]\r\nLibrary\r\nMain article: Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Library\r\nHKUST Library Building\r\n\r\nThe HKUST Lee Shau Kee Library, part of the Hong Kong Academic Library Link (HKALL), occupies a central location of the campus. Connected to the Academic Building, it is accessible directly from the Hong Kong Jockey Club Atrium. It spans five floors with over 12,350 sq m[18] of floor space, providing more than 3,674 seats as well as computing facilities. It offers a wide array of information resources, both local and remote. In addition to over 720,000 print and electronic volumes and a large collection of media resources, it provides access to more than 47,000 periodical titles, a large number of e-books, databases, and other digital information resources.[18] The library also includes a 24-hour-capable Learning Commons which provides a technology-rich environment for active learning and education.\r\n\r\nThe library owns a collection of old maps of China and the rest of Asia, produced by Chinese and Western cartographers over the last 500 years.[19] A selection of these maps, providing an insight into the history of international geographic knowledge, was published by the library in a limited-edition (1000 copies) volume in 2003.[20]\r\nAncillary services\r\n\r\nThe campus boasts 19 catering outlets including fast food restaurants, a Chinese restaurant as well as a bar; other ancillary facilities in the academic complexes include three banks, a bookstore, a supermarket, clinics (consisting of a medical clinic providing free outpatient service to all full-time students and staff, a student dental clinic, and a staff dental clinic) and Students\' Union offices.\r\nReputation and rankings\r\nUniversity rankings\r\nGlobal\r\nARWU World[21] 	201–300\r\nTHE World[23] 	41\r\nQS World[22] 	37\r\nRegional\r\nTimes Asia[25] 	5\r\nQS Asia[24] 	7\r\nSpecial\r\nTHE Under 50[27] 	1\r\nQS Under 50[26] 	2\r\n\r\nHKUST had been previously ranked Asia\'s No.1 by the independent regional QS University Rankings: Asia for three consecutive years between 2011 and 2013.[28][29] It\'s one of the fastest growing institutions as ranked #1 young university by Times Higher Education World University Rankings in 2018 and #2 by QS world\'s under-50 universities in 2018.[30][31]The THE\'s World Reputation Rankings of 2017 considered it the third reputable in the territory,[32] while it was first in the HKU Public Opinion Programme survey (2016).[33]\r\n\r\nAccording to Global University Employability Ranking 2017, the University\'s graduates have the highest employment rate among universities in Greater China for 5 years in a row, ranked 12th worldwide.[34] Besides overall rankings, a list of subject rankings of Hong Kong tertiary institutions is available to show the strength of its individual disciplines ranked by the above organisations.

Ramanathan in 1959 in the State Assembly and later crystallised when he was nominated chairman of the Penang University Project committee.[11] The acquisition of a piece of land in Sungai Ara was then followed by the ceremonial laying of the foundation stone by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Y.T.M Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj on 7 August 1967.\r\n\r\nUSM was established as a statutory body in 1969 as the second university in Malaysia. It was first known as Universiti Pulau Pinang. The university operated on borrowed premises at the Malayan Teachers\' Training College at Gelugor. In 1971, it moved to its present 239-hectare site at Minden (formerly Minden Barracks of the British Far East Command) in Gelugor, 10 kilometres from the city of Georgetown.\r\n\r\nThere are two other USM campuses: one at Kubang Kerian in Kelantan, known as the Health campus, and the other at Seri Ampangan, Nibong Tebal in Penang, known as the Engineering campus. The former houses the School of Medical Sciences, the School of Health Sciences and the School of Dental Sciences, while the latter houses the six engineering schools.\r\n\r\nUniversiti Sains Malaysia teaches in the fields of Pure Sciences, Applied Sciences, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Building Science and Technology, Social Sciences, Humanities and Education as well as conducts research.\r\n\r\nUSM offers courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels to more than 28,000 students. USM has won the Asian Innovation Award in which USM emerged as the only winner from this country.[12]\r\nOrganisation\r\n\r\nThe management of the university is carried out through the executive power of the Board of Directors, made up of members chosen from the university, representatives from government departments and those appointed by the Ministry of Higher Education. There are three Deputy Vice-Chancellors led by the Vice-Chancellor.\r\nOmbudsman\r\n\r\nIn August 2011 USM created a new role of Ombudsman to deal with staff issues and protect whistleblowers.[13] The USM Ombudsman is Prof. Dato\' Seri Dr. MD. Salleh Yaapar, who is a former staff of the USM and is on a rolling 2-year contract.\r\nChief Integrity Officer\r\n\r\nIn July 2012, following a presentation by the Chief of Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, the VC of USM promises to create a new role of Chief Integrity Officer to cultivate academic integrity among students, lecturers and staff.[14] The current Chief Integrity Officer is Khairul Anuar Che Azmi, the university’s first ombudsman and is also the Legal Advisor.\r\nAcademic programmes\r\n\r\nTwenty four academic schools, 14 centres and 7 units have been established. Of the schools, 12 are applied science and technology-based schools: Civil Engineering, Aerospace Engineering; Chemical Engineering; Electrical and Electronic Engineering; Materials and Mineral Resources Engineering; Mechanical Engineering; Housing, Building and Planning; Industrial Technology; Medical Sciences; Dental Sciences; Health Sciences; and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The three liberal arts schools are Educational Studies, Humanities, and Social Sciences. The pure science schools are Biological Sciences, Chemical Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Computer Sciences, and Physics, all of which offer courses that are similar to those available in other universities. There is offshore collaboration with KLE University, India offering the Doctor of Medicine(USM) undergraduate degree. This offshore five-year M.D. programme is conducted at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (Belgaum), KLE University, Belgaum, India. In India, USM also has a collaboration with the James Lind Institute for conducting Translational Medicine programs.[15][16]\r\n\r\nIn December 1989, the School of Management was set up, having evolved from the Management program within the School of Social Sciences. As part of its continuing expansion, the university established the School of Computer Sciences and the School of Communication as of March 1995.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Professor Maqsudul Alam, set up the Centre for Chemical Biology (CCB)[17] where he became its first Chief Executive Officer and Director, and sequenced the genome for rubber in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThe centres and ancillary services include the Centre for Languages and Translation, the National Poison Centre, the Doping Control Centre, the Centre for Archaeological Research Malaysia, the Centre for Educational Technology and Multimedia, the Computer Centre, the Centre for Knowledge, Communication and Technology and the Islamic Centre. There are research centres, namely the Centre for Policy Research, the Centre for Drug Research and the Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies. The distance education program offered through the School of Distance Education was adopted by the university in 1971.\r\nThe main gate of the main campus\r\n\r\nUSM is one of five universities in Malaysia that have been identified as research-intensive universities, with the other being University of Malaya, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.\r\nCampuses\r\n\r\nThe Main campus has the name of a German city (Minden) because the campus was built on the territory of the former British Minden Barracks, which themselves were named after the Battle of Minden.\r\n\r\nBesides the main campus in Minden, USM has one at Kubang Kerian in Kelantan known as Health Campus and another at Seri Ampangan, Nibong Tebal in mainland Penang known as Engineering Campus.\r\n\r\nStarted as a USM hospital in 1982, the Health campus has expanded after the School of Medical Science was moved from the main campus to the present site which is 73 hectares. The School of Medical Science was moved from the main campus in June 1984. There are two other schools in the health campus — the School of Dental Science and the School of Allied Health Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe Engineering Campus was originally located at Tronoh, Perak, and named Perak Branch Campus (KCP). After operating in the state for 15 years (1986–2001), the Engineering Campus moved to the present site in Nibong Tebal, Penang.\r\nWikimedia | © OpenStreetMap\r\nLocation of the main campus in Penang\r\nSchools\r\n\r\nUSM is the one of the Malaysian public universities to use term school (in Malay; Pusat Pengajian) instead of the term faculty that is used in other Malaysian public universities.\r\nTechnology-based schools\r\n\r\nAll located at the Engineering Campus except the School of Housing, Building and Planning (main campus) and The School of Industrial Technology (main campus).\r\n\r\n    School of Aerospace Engineering\r\n    School of Civil Engineering\r\n    School of Chemical Engineering\r\n    School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering\r\n    School of Materials and Mineral Resources Engineering\r\n    School of Mechanical Engineering\r\n    School of Housing, Building and Planning\r\n    School of Industrial Technology\r\n\r\nLiberal arts schools\r\n\r\nAll located at main campus, island of Penang.\r\n\r\n    School of Arts\r\n    School of Communication\r\n    School of Educational Studies\r\n    School of Humanities\r\n    School of Social Sciences\r\n    School of Management\r\n    School of Languages, Literacies and Translation ( http://www.ppblt.usm.my/ )\r\n\r\nScience Schools\r\n\r\nAll located at main campus, island of Penang.\r\n\r\n    School of Biological Sciences\r\n    School of Chemical Sciences\r\n    School of Mathematical Sciences\r\n    School of Computer Sciences\r\n    School of Physics\r\n\r\nHealth Science Schools\r\n\r\nAll located at Health Campus, Kelantan except The School of Pharmacy (located in main campus) and Advanced Medical and Dental Institute (located in Bertam outside Penang Island AMDI).\r\n\r\n    School of Medical Sciences\r\n    School of Dental Sciences\r\n    School of Health Sciences\r\n    School of Pharmaceutical Sciences\r\n    Advanced Medical and Dental Institute (AMDI)\r\n\r\nResearch\r\nDewan Tuanku Syed Putra: The main auditorium of USM on the main campus on Penang Island\r\n\r\nThe Science Fund funding is the main source of R&D for USM. However, to promote research, the university allocates money from its operating funds annually as incentive and for short-term research purposes. External funds, mainly in the form of research grants, awards and consultancies won by individual academic staff members, also feature prominently. There are external sources of funding as well, but these are largely ad hoc and do not, as a rule, result in the development of major research facilities. Some external research links have been established through individual and through institutional networking arrangements.\r\nResearch areas\r\n\r\nResearch areas at USM include brain and neuroscience, environmental science, aquaculture, biomedical and pharmaceutical studies, natural language processing and computer aided translation, information technology, food technology, polymer science and technology, biotechnology, distance education, geographical information system, structure analysis, materials science, engineering, surface chemistry, and robotic vision. Penang has research facilities for collaborative search, particularly in coastal pollution, mangrove ecosystem and marine aquaculture.\r\nEducation\r\nGraduate studies\r\nThe international office of USM now known as International Mobility & Collaboration Centre or IMCC\r\n\r\nUSM offers three modes of study for the graduate programmes, i.e., by research, by a combination of coursework and research (mixed mode), or by coursework. In 2009, there were 9,011[18] students in the master’s and doctoral level programmes with 24.9% of them nationals from more than 40 countries. The majority of the foreign students are from other parts of Southeast Asia as well as the Middle East.\r\nUndergraduate studies\r\n\r\nAlmost all undergraduate degree programmes at the university require a minimum full-time residence of three years. Degrees in engineering, health sciences, pharmacy, medicine and dentistry require minimum periods of study between four and five years. Most undergraduate courses are taught in English, especially in science courses, except for humanities and social science. International students have to demonstrate a level of proficiency in the national language as part of the entrance criteria. However they will be taught as one of compulsory subjects once they enroll as a student.\r\nOther study programmes\r\n\r\nUSM has programmes for foreign students, and they can undertake one or two semesters. These students are considered full-time and enjoy the benefits of USM\'s academic and physical facilities.\r\n\r\nThe School of Distance Education was established in 1971 to provide opportunities for local working adults to obtain a tertiary qualification. These students are able to undertake undergraduate courses while they are in full-time employment. At present four undergraduate degree programmes are available through distance learning: Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Social Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Management.\r\nCollaboration with Overseas Universities\r\n\r\nThe University and the University of Indonesia (UI) collaborates with the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) on SUSS’s BA Malay Language and Literature[19].\r\nDepartments\r\n\r\nLibrary of Universiti Sains Malaysia[20]\r\nActivities\r\nThe football field on USM main campus\r\n\r\nUSM has facilities for student accommodation, sporting and recreation. The university offers housing for approximately 75% of its students. They are known as student villages or hostels (Desasiswa in Malay), and they are on campus. Cafeterias can be found all around the university area.\r\n\r\nUSM provides sporting facilities such as archery range, cricket, football field, badminton courts, tennis courts, hockey ground, rugby field, softball, squash courts, and basketball courts. Its ground was used for the 2008 U/19 Cricket World Cup.\r\n\r\nOther activities include cultural activities, leadership programs, community service programs and excellence programs with the co-operation of the Student Advisory and Development Unit, the Sports Unit, the Arts and Cultural Development Unit, Hostel Management. Activities are realised through societies, clubs, sports and cultural activities, motivation workshops and debate competitions. Among others, USM has a jazz orchestra called the USM Jazz Band that is composed of student musicians from various schools in the university.[21]\r\n\r\nThere are annual activities such as forums, workshops and programs in conjunction with the National Day celebrations such as the Ambang Merdeka Night and the Merdeka Campus Walk, and religious activities such as Qur\'an Recitation and Ramadhan Appreciation Month in the holy month of Ramadhan.\r\nHostels\r\n\r\nThe hostels known as student villages or (Desasiswa in Malay) under the property of the University of Science Malaysia are as follows:\r\n\r\nMain Campus\r\n\r\n    Aman Damai Fajar Harapan\r\n    Bakti Permai Cahaya Gemilang\r\n    Indah Kembara\r\n    Restu\r\n    Saujana\r\n    Tekun\r\n\r\nEngineering Campus\r\n\r\n    Jaya Lembaran Utama\r\n\r\nHealth Campus\r\n\r\n    Murni Nurani\r\n\r\nRanking\r\n\r\nThe university was ranked 111th in the World University Rankings 2004[22] published by the Times Higher Education Supplement. However, it dropped out of the list of top 200 universities in the world in 2005.\r\n\r\nUSM\'s then vice-chancellor Prof Tan Sri Dato\' Dzulkifli Abdul Razak said that the addition of new criteria such as the employer survey could have contributed to the sharp drop in the university\'s integrity: \"Our poor standing could also be attributed to the fact that we are a relatively young university compared to UM which is 100 years old. They have built up a stable reputation in that time.\" Prof. Dzulkifli also cited the poor staff-student ratio in Malaysian universities: \"Over the past years we have doubled our intake. USM now has 35,000 students including 28,000 undergraduates but the number of lecturers, about 1,400 has not increased in tandem.\"[citation needed]\r\n\r\nOn 3 September 2008, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) was declared the Apex (Accelerated Programme for Excellence) University by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia.

(6, 27, 'Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)', 'University Putra Malaysia (UPM; formally known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia or College of Agriculture Malaya or School of Agriculture) is recognised by the independent government assessments as one of Malaysia\'s leading research universities offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses with a focus on agricultural sciences and its related fields. Founded in 1931 as the School of Agriculture, UPM\'s main campus is in Serdang, Selangor. It was formerly known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia or the Agricultural University of Malaysia. Now, UPM offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in most fields such as science, engineering, medicine, veterinary medicine, business and social science.It was ranked as the joint 229th best university in the world in 2017 by Quacquarelli Symonds.[5] and it was ranked 36th in Best Asian Universities and the 2nd best university in Malaysia. \r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nThe School of Agriculture was officially instituted on 21 May 1931 by John Scott,[6] an administrative officer of the British colonial Straits Settlements. The school was on a 22-acre piece of land in Serdang and offered two programmes: a three-year diploma programme and a one-year certificate course in Agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn 1947, the school was declared the College of Agriculture Malaya by Sir Edward Gent, the then Governor of the Malayan Union. The establishment of Universiti Pertanian Malaysia came about when the College of Agriculture in Serdang merged with the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Malaya. Dr. Mohd. Rashdan bin Haji Baba, the then principal of the College of Agriculture Malaya, was appointed as the first vice-chancellor by virtue of the provisions of Section 18 of the Universities and University Colleges Act, 1971. With the first intake of 1,559 students, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia had its first academic session in July 1973 in the three central faculties and one basic division: the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Forestry, Faculty of Agriculture, and a Division of Foundation Studies.\r\n\r\nIn the early 80s, UPM extended its area of studies to include the field of Science and Technology (S&T). In 1997, the name Universiti Pertanian Malaysia was changed to Universiti Putra Malaysia by Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, as a strategic gesture to portray the status of UPM as a centre of higher education capable of providing fields of studies, especially in science and information technology, which facilitate national development in the new millennium.[7]\r\nCampus\r\nCampus of Universiti Putra Malaysia.jpg\r\n\r\nThe university since its inception as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia, has had two branch campuses apart from the main campus at Serdang, Selangor. The UPM branch campuses were in Bintulu, Sarawak and Mengabang Telipot, Terengganu.\r\n\r\nThe campus in Terengganu has been upgraded to the University College of Science and Technology Malaysia (KUSTEM), with its own management and administration. KUSTEM officially broke away from UPM on 1 July 2001.\r\n\r\nThe Medicine and Health Sciences faculty maintains a campus complex adjacent to a local hospital in Serdang.[8]\r\nAcademic profile\r\n\r\nUPM began its academic life in 1973 with three founding Faculties and a Division of Basic Sciences. The first intake of 1,559 students were for the bachelor\'s degree in Agriculture, Diploma in Home Technology, Diploma in Animal Health and Production, Diploma in Science with Education, and Preliminary Programme. UPM now offers 59 bachelor programmes, 7 diploma programmes,[9] and 12 Masters and Doctoral programmes. There are 16 Faculties, eight Centres, nine Institutes, two Schools, a University Park and a branch campus in Bintulu, Sarawak. The Doctor of Medicine program provided by the Medical and Health Science division of the university was fully recognised by the Malaysia Medical Council on 5 June 2001.[10]\r\nFaculties\r\nFaculty of Engineering\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Engineering[11] of Universiti Putra Malaysia was established on 1 January 1975 at the main Serdang Campus, some 22 kilometres to the south of Kuala Lumpur. It is one of the largest faculties at UPM with a student population of over 3000. The campus’ location at the heart of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) provides the faculty with access to the array of IT and multimedia facilities available in the Corridor.\r\n\r\nThe eight academic departments housed in the faculty offer a similar number of Bachelor of Engineering degree programs. Out of 800 postgraduates, almost 50% are international students. In addition to providing facilities and opportunities for teaching and research, the faculty has established Research Centres in engineering and related fields.\r\n\r\nThe \"Centres of Excellence\" organise research and development programs, consultancy and professional training using expertise from disciplines in the university. The objective is to secure contracts from the public or private sectors to generate income for the faculty. Centers of Excellence have been established as listed below.\r\n\r\n    Road Safety Research Center (RSRC)\r\n    Housing Research Center (HRC)\r\n    Mountainous Terrain Development Research Center (MTDRC)\r\n    Centre of Excellence for Wireless and Photonic Network (WiPNET)\r\n    Centre of Excellence on Lightning Protection (CELP)\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Malaysia Plan ended in 2005 and, during its duration, most of the approved research projects were completed. Under the Ninth Malaysia Plan, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation offers three research grants: Technofund, Innofund, and Sciencefund. In addition, the Ministry of Higher Education initiated the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme and UPM offers the Research University Grant Scheme.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Engineering comprises eight main departments:\r\n\r\n    Aerospace\r\n    Biological and Agricultural\r\n    Civil\r\n    Electric and Electronic\r\n    Chemical and Environment\r\n    Computer and Communication Systems\r\n    Mechanical and Manufacturing\r\n    Process and Food.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Science\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Science[12] was established as the Division of Basic Sciences in 1972. Its objective was to offer basic science courses required by other faculties in the university. In 1975, the status of the division was upgraded to a faculty and named the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies.\r\n\r\nSince then the faculty has set up the Department of Environmental Sciences and the Department of Computer Sciences which later were upgraded to form two new faculties and the transfer of the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology to the newly formed Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences. Ever since the restructuring, it was renamed as the Faculty of Science in 2004.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Science comprises four main departments and one centre:\r\n\r\n    Department of Biology\r\n    Department of Physics\r\n    Department of Chemistry\r\n    Department of Mathematics\r\n    Catalysis Science and Technology Research Centre (PutraCAT)\r\n\r\nFaculty of Medicine and Health Sciences\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences[13] was established on 1 August 1996 as a result of the merger between the Department of Biomedical of the Faculty of Veterinary and Animal Science with Nutrition and Community Health Department of the Faculty Human Ecology. Currently, there are 1,845 full-time students in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences.\r\n\r\nFMHS complex has many facilities which include administration building, library, lecture halls, tutorial rooms and laboratory. In addition, there are four blocks of students’ hostels that can accommodate 2,000 students, student centre, food court, and mosque.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Medicine and Health Sciences comprises various departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Medicine\r\n    Department of Community Health\r\n    Department of Science (Biomedical Sciences)\r\n    Department of Science (Dietetics)\r\n    Department of Science (Dietetics)\r\n    Department of Science (Nutrition and Community Health)\r\n    Department of Science (Environmental & Occupational Health)\r\n    Department of Nursing\r\n\r\nFaculty of Economics and Management\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Economics and Management (FEP)[14] (formerly known as the Faculty of Resource Economics and Agribusiness) was established in January 1974, as the fourth faculty in Universiti Putra Malaysia (formerly known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia). It was established in response to the needs for competent professionals in the fields of agribusiness and resource economics.\r\n\r\nEver since its inception, FEP has grown in student intake, number of academic programs offered, research activities, and professional services. This is the first faculty in Malaysia gaining AACSB status. This accreditation is awarded to the Faculty of Economics and Management (FEP) and Putra Business School or PBS (formerly known as the Graduate School of Management or GSM).\r\n\r\nThe achievement of UPM and seven other international universities was announced by the President and Chief Executive Officer of AACSB International, John J. Fernandes at Tampa, Florida via www.aacsb.edu recently.\r\n\r\nTo cater to the education needs of working adults, FEP established Executive Program Unit (UPE) in 1997 by offering part-time programs to candidates with working experience in the public or private sector. This program has thus expanded through collaboration with Malaysian Airlines (MAS) Academy in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe same year, FEP established External Program Unit and Distance Learning Unit in 2001.\r\n\r\nFEP offers three bachelor-level programs: Bachelor of Accounting, Bachelor of Economics and Bachelor of Business Administration. At the graduate level, FEP offers Masters of Economics, Masters of Science and PhD in Economics.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Economics and Management comprises three main departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Economics\r\n    Department of Management and Marketing\r\n    Department of Accounting and Finance\r\n\r\nFaculty of Agriculture\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Agriculture[15] is one of three founding faculties that made up the formation of Universiti Pertanian Malaysia (now Universiti Putra Malaysia) in 1971. Beginning with seven departments under this faculty, most of these departments were later developed to become other faculties.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1998, the faculty had three academic departments — Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, Department of Plant Protection, and Department of Soil Science.\r\n\r\nBeginning from 1 January 1999, the restructuring process at Universiti Putra Malaysia involved the Faculty of Agriculture. The faculty now has six departments — Crop Science, Animal Science, Plant Protection, Land Management, Agribusiness and Information System, and Agriculture Technology.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Agriculture comprises seven main departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Crop Science\r\n    Department of Plant Protection\r\n    Department of Land Management\r\n    Department of Animal Science\r\n    Department of Agribusiness and Information Systems\r\n    Department of Agriculture Technology\r\n    Department of Aquaculture\r\n\r\nFaculty of Food Science and Technology\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Food Science and Technology[16] had its humble beginnings in 1976 with the establishment of the Department of Food Science and Technology under the Faculty of Agriculture. The establishment of the department is in line with the need of the country to fulfill the shortage of skilled employees in the field of science-based food. At that time, only one undergraduate program was offered: Bachelor of Food Science and Technology.\r\n\r\nOn 1 March 1982, the Department of Food Science and Technology was upgraded to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology. There were two departments under the faculty: Department of Food Technology and Department of Food Science. In 1986, the Faculty was renamed Faculty of Food Science and Biotechnology (FSMB) with the establishment of the Department of Biotechnology that offered the Bachelor of Science (Biotechnology) program with six modules: Plant Biotechnology, Molecular Biotechnology, Food Biotechnology, Industrial Biotechnology, Environmental Biotechnology, and Management.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, the faculty began offering the Bachelor of Science (Food Studies) program with two options: Food Quality Management and Food Management. In 1997 and 2000, the Food Service Administration and Food Marketing options were offered through the same program. On 1 August 2004, the faculty was renamed to the Faculty of Food Science and Technology when the Department of Biotechnology formed a separate faculty. In January 2005, the Department of Food Service and Management was established to strengthen the existing programs in the faculty. The faculty began offering the Bachelor of Science (Food Service Management) and Master of Food Technology in September 2012.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Food Science and Technology comprises three main departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Food Science\r\n    Department of Food Technology\r\n    Department of Food Service and Management\r\n\r\nFaculty of Forestry\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Forestry[17] is one of the founding faculties during the establishment of Universiti Putra Malaysia, formerly known as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia in 1971.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Forestry comprises three main departments and one section:\r\n\r\n    Department of Forest Management\r\n    Department of Forest Production\r\n    Department of Recreation and Eco-tourism\r\n    Forest & Plantation Section\r\n\r\nFaculty of Veterinary Medicine\r\n\r\nFaculty of Veterinary Medicine has six main departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Veterinary Pathology & Microbiology\r\n    Department of Pre-Clinical Veterinary\r\n    Department of Veterinary Clinical Studies\r\n    Department of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnostics\r\n    Department of Medicine Companion Animal Surgery\r\n    Department of Medicine and Exotic & Farm Animal Surgery\r\n\r\nFaculty of Educational Studies\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Educational Studies[18] serves to produce teachers who can teach at the secondary school level as well as professionals who are responsible for human resource development. At present, the faculty offers Bachelor of Education degrees in Agricultural Science, Home Science, Physical Education, the Teaching of Bahasa Malaysia as the First Language, the Teaching of English as a Second Language, Guidance and Counselling as well as Information Technology.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Educational Studies has six main departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Foundations of Education\r\n    Department of Sport Studies\r\n    Department of Science and Technical Education\r\n    Department of Language and Humanities Education\r\n    Department of Professional Development and Continuing Education\r\n    Department of Counselor Education and Counseling Psychology\r\n\r\nFaculty of Human Ecology\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Human Ecology[19] was officially established on 1 April [year missing] through the merger of the Department of Human Development Studies from the Faculty of Agriculture with the Department of Social Sciences from the Faculty of Educational Studies. Four departments were then established, namely, the Department of Community Nutrition and Health, Department of Resource Management and Consumer Studies.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nCurrently, the faculty has five departments and an additional unit under its administration: the External Education and Industrial Training Unit.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Human Ecology comprises five main departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Resource Management and Consumer Studies\r\n    Department of Human Development and Family Studies\r\n    Department of Social and Development Sciences\r\n    Department of Government and Civilization Studies\r\n    Department of Music\r\n\r\nFaculty of Modern Languages & Communication\r\n\r\nThe formation of Faculty of Modern Languages & Communication[20] can be traced back to the establishment of the National Language Division and the English Language Division in the Agriculture College of Malaya (Kolej Pertanian Malaya) when the Language Act 1976 took effect. Both units were combined to form the Language Division in 1971 which was subsequently upgraded into the Language Department in 1972 and was placed under the Faculty of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nOn 15 January 1975, the Language Department was placed in the Faculty of Educational Studies. On 4 January 1995, the Language Department was upgraded to the Faculty of Language Studies. On 1 January 1999, the Department of Development Communication (which was in the Faculty of Human Ecology) was transferred to the Faculty of Modern Languages as the Department of Communication. With this restructuring, the Faculty of Language Studies was renamed as the Faculty of Modern Languages and Communication (FBMK).\r\n\r\nCurrently, Faculty of Modern Languages & Communication comprises four main departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Malay Language and Linguistics\r\n    Department of English Language\r\n    Department of Foreign Languages\r\n    Department of Communication\r\n\r\nFaculty of Design & Architecture\r\n\r\nThe idea to establish the Faculty of Design and Architecture[21] in UPM originated with a proposal paper titled \"Proposed Establishment of the Faculty of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture.\" It was submitted to the Faculty Agriculture in 1976. However, the proposal was never brought up for further consideration by the Faculty\'s administration. Nevertheless, a group of teaching staff in Landscape Architecture was recruited in 1980 to teach \"landscape subjects\" in the diploma and bachelor of agriculture programmes.\r\n\r\nThe first landscape course was offered in 1984. It was a three-credit course titled \"AGRO 472 – An Approach to Landscape Design\". It became popular and managed to attract many agricultural students who later graduated and continued their studies in landscape architecture at the undergraduate and graduate level overseas. Many of these early graduates have since returned and assumed successful practice or became professors at institutions of higher learning.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, the Faculty of Engineering, UPM proposed to offer the Architecture programme in UPM. However, the idea never materialised until the Faculty of Agriculture was given the task by the university\'s management to look into the feasibility of offering landscape architecture and architecture in UPM. A committee was formed in the Faculty of Agriculture 1994 and in 1995 a report was sent to the vice-chancellor proposing the setting up of a new faculty offering courses in design and the creative arts. With the strong support of the university\'s management the Faculty of Design and Architecture was approved by the University\'s Senate, Board of Directors and the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nThe new faculty was officially established on 26 June 1996 and began its operation with the offering of the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture and Master of Landscape Architecture programmes under the new Department of Landscape Architecture. Subsequently, the Department of Architecture was established in 1999 and the Department of Industrial Design in 2002. The faculty began with an enrolment of 40 students. Today, it has expanded rapidly offering five programmes with an enrolment of more than 400 students at the undergraduate, master and doctoral levels.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Design and Architecture comprises three main departments:\r\n\r\n    Landscape Architecture Department\r\n    Industrial Design Department\r\n    Architecture Department\r\n\r\nFaculty of Computer Science & Information Technology\r\n\r\nIn October 1998, the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology[22] was officially established to meet the demands for additional academic programmes and to keep pace with rapid developments. The setting up of the faculty parallels the goal of the university to stay abreast of developments in Information Technology.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the faculty constitutes of four departments: Department of Multimedia, Department of Computer Science, Department of Software Engineering and Information System, and the Department of Communication Technology and Networks.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Computer Science and Information Technology comprises four main departments:\r\n\r\n    Multimedia Department\r\n    Software Engineering and Information System Department\r\n    Computer Science Department\r\n    Communication Technology and Network Department\r\n\r\nFaculty of Biotechnology & Biomolecular Sciences\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences (BioTech UPM)[23] was established on 1 August 2004 with the merger of two departments: the Department of Biotechnology (from the Faculty of Food Science and Biotechnology) and the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology (from the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies). With the formation of BioTech UPM, all activities involving biotechnology in UPM are organised under one administration.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Biotechnology & Biomolecular Sciences comprises four main departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Bioprocess Technology\r\n    Department of Cell & Molecular Biology\r\n    Department of Biochemistry\r\n    Department of Microbiology\r\n\r\nFaculty of Environmental Studies\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Environmental Studies,[24] Universiti Putra Malaysia, was established on 1 September 2004.\r\n\r\nIt developed from the Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies. The Department of Environmental Sciences at UPM was established in August 1976 under the Faculty of Science. With the entry of the new department the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies. In the same year the Bachelor of Environment programme was introduced. This degree is as a professional degree by the Malaysian Public Services Department. It was the first environment programme in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Environmental Studies, Universiti Putra Malaysia, is the only academic body offering degrees in environmental science and management in Malaysia at the Bachelor, Masters and Doctoral levels. There are two Bachelor programmes, two Masters programme and one Doctoral programme offered. More information on these programmes may be found on the Academic Programmes pages.\r\n\r\nThe academic staff has a wide range of interests. Projects are carried out with members of other departments inside and outside the University. For example, there is long-term co-operation with the Department of Environment, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Housing, and local government, local authorities, and with international agencies such as the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS).\r\n\r\nFaculty of Environmental Studies has two main departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Environmental Management\r\n    Department of Environmental Sciences\r\n\r\nFaculty of Agriculture & Food Sciences\r\n\r\nUniversiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu Sarawak Campus (UPMKB)[25] is the oldest campus in Sarawak. The history of Universiti Putra Malaysia Bintulu Sarawak Campus can be traced to 10 August 1974, when it was a temporary campus under the National Resources Training Centre in Semenggok, Kuching.\r\n\r\nThe campus relocated to its permanent site in Bintulu, Sarawak in June 1987. On 27 August 1987, Universiti Pertanian Malaysia Sarawak was officially established as a branch campus through the three centres of learning — Applied Sciences, Basic Sciences, and Social Sciences and Management.\r\n\r\nThree diploma level programs were on offer: the Diploma in Agriculture, Diploma in Forestry, and Diploma in Agribusiness programs, as well as an initiation program.\r\n\r\nUPM was closed temporarily in 1992 and was operational again in November 2001, based on UPM 2001-2010 third strategic plan which was to upgrade UPM into and international center for agriculture, bioresource studies and services. UPMKB\'s main focus is in agribio fields such as agriculture, forestry, fishery, livestock, food and environment.\r\n\r\nUPMKB is a branch campus of UPM with one faculty, the Faculty of Agriculture and Food Sciences. This faculty comprises five academic departments: Department of Crop Science, Department of Forestry Science, Department of Social Science, Department of Basic Science and Engineering, and Department of Animal Science and Fishery. The faculty offers Diploma, Bachelor, Master with thesis and PhD programmes.\r\n\r\nFaculty of Agriculture & Food Sciences (UPMKB) comprises five main departments:\r\n\r\n    Department of Crop Science\r\n    Department of Forestry Science\r\n    Department of Basic Science and Engineering\r\n    Department of Social Science\r\n    Department of Animal Science and Fishery\r\n\r\nInstitutes\r\nInstitute of Bioscience\r\nSee also: Institute of Bioscience\r\n\r\nThe Institute of Bioscience (IBS),[26] Universiti Putra Malaysia was established on 1 August 1996 and was the first research institute founded in UPM. IBS was established to boost research and development (R&D) and postgraduate training in fields of biological sciences. The emphasis on research was given to strengthen the scientific and technological capabilities of the country as well as to develop relevant human capital to support the Industrial and Agricultural Master Plan. Since its inception, IBS’ areas of research have grown and it is gradually developing into a leading research centre in UPM.\r\n\r\nOver the past 17 years, the Institute of Bioscience has rearranged and developed the existing units into five laboratories. Each laboratory has two main functions, i.e., doing research and providing the Service and Facility Unit. The five laboratories are\r\n\r\n    Laboratory of Natural Products\r\n    Laboratory of Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics\r\n    Laboratory of Molecular Biomedicine\r\n    Laboratory of Biotechnology Marine\r\n    Laboratory of Cancer Research UPM-MAKNA\r\n\r\nInstitute of Advanced Technology\r\n\r\nInstitute of Advanced Technology (ITMA),[27] Universiti Putra Malaysia was established in 1999 as an interdisciplinary advanced research institute. In line with the university\'s research restructuring in 2012, ITMA has reformed its niche area to Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology focusing on areas such as materials synthesis and characterisation, materials processing and technology, and materials applications in sensors and functional devices.\r\n\r\n    Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology\r\n    Green Engineering and Sustainable Technology\r\n    Sensor Technology\r\n    Spatial and Numerical Modelling\r\n\r\nInstitute for Mathematical Research\r\n\r\nThe Institute for Mathematical Research (INSPEM)[28] is a research institute specialising in research in mathematics and other areas whose major components are areas in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe institute was established to fill the need for such a research centre in the country. It began operating on 1 April 2002 after its establishment was approved by the Division of Higher Education in November 2001. The institute is under the administration of UPM and is subjected to the regulations and stipulated in the statute on the establishment of institutes in UPM.\r\n\r\nThe main activities of INSPEM include planning, identifying and implementing research in Theoretical Studies, Applied and Computational Statistics, areas of Computational Sciences and Informatics and Innovational Methods in Education. The institute also serves as two-way channel between it and the public and private agencies through which research products can be channelled and problem requiring mathematical treatment can be received and examined at the institute.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it provides opportunities for collaborative research with agencies from inside and outside UPM. It is also a primary function of INSPEM to invite potential young researchers to carry out research that leads to postgraduate degrees.\r\n\r\nFour research laboratories have been formed, each led by a head of laboratory:\r\n\r\n    Laboratory of Theoretical Mathematics\r\n    Laboratory of Statistics and Applied Mathematics\r\n    Laboratory of Mathematical Sciences and Applications\r\n    Laboratory of Education and Mathematics Literacy\r\n\r\nHalal Product Research Institute\r\n\r\nEstablishment of Halal Food Institute as a research center is one of halal proactive measures to put UPM UPM as the leading center of excellence in agricultural education in the country. This establishment has submitted proposals to the management of the University in 2003 and was approved at the Management Committee Meeting University 110th on 26 and 31 March 2003. However, the establishment of this institute can not be implemented because of financial problems the university at the time. Therefore, Faculty of Food Science and Technology has taken the initiative to establish the Halal Food Unit in June 2003.\r\n\r\nIn August 2004, the Halal Food Unit in collaboration with Yayasan Dakwah Islamiah Malaysia (YADIM) has organised a \"Workshop on Global Halal Hub Development Malaysia\" in conjunction with the 1st Malaysian International Halal Showcase (Mihas) 2004. Resolution of the workshop titled \"Proposed Development of Halal Food Hub Global Malaysia\" was presented to the Honorable Prime Minister of Malaysia by Y.Bhg. Vice-Chancellor of the university in the opening MIHAS 2004 on 16 August 2004. Following this development, the Ministry of Higher Education has approved and agreed that UPM lead the national agricultural education center on 30 August 2004. To support this initiative, UPM has proposed the establishment of Halal Food Institute and has received approval from the Ministry of Higher Education on 1 June 2005. this initiative was implemented to help Malaysia to realise the aspiration to emerge as a global hub for halal food.\r\n\r\nFollowing the change in administration policy UPM, several workshops were held to address the future direction related issues RMK9 and strengthen the position of UPM as a research university. To enhance research excellence, UPM has held workshops directions from 25–27 May 2006 and has established eight universities and research focus areas Halal products have been placed as one of the focus areas.\r\n\r\nThus, on 1 July 2006, after UPM implement changes Basically, the name Halal Food Institute (IMH) was converted to Halal Products Research Institute (IPPH).[29] This amendment is to broaden the scope of research IPPH beyond the scope of food and put some new research scope of consumables Muslims and Islamic business. Establishment of Halal Products Research Institute is acting as a \'one-stop center\' through a comprehensive approach, balanced and \'multifaceted\' to review all aspects of halal products on a national and global level.\r\nInstitute of Tropical Forestry and Forest Products (INTROP)\r\n\r\nThe Institute of Tropical Forestry and Forest Products (INTROP)[30] was established on 1 October 2006 by merging the Institute of Biocomposite and the Rain Forest Academy. It was a very timely merger and it consolidated UPM\'s expertise and resources to provide solutions to current issues such as the dwindling supply of natural resources and the optimisation of bioresources.\r\n\r\nINTROP\'s activities focus on forest canopy management, bioresources valuation and sustainability, sustainable utilisation of biocomposite products, product development and innovation and also market exploration and competitiveness.\r\nInstitute of Gerontology\r\n\r\nThe Institute of Gerontology (IG),[31] UPM was established on 1 April 2002. Professor Dr. Tengku Aizan Hamid is the founding director of the Institute of Gerontology and is assisted by a deputy director and two head of laboratories.\r\n\r\nOver the years, the institute has carried out research in numerous areas of old age and ageing with funding from federal and state agencies, government ministries (e.g., MWFCD, MOE, MOSTI) and departments, as well as international bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).[citation needed]\r\nInstitute of Agricultural & Food Policy Studies\r\n\r\nUniversiti Putra Malaysia is an institution that has always been proactive in contributing ideas in the field of agriculture to both the government and community at large.[citation needed] Among these contributions include policy suggestions that are founded on the results of research and development conducted at UPM.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nUPM established the Pusat Kajian Dasar Pertanian, PKDP or Agricultural Policy Research Centre in 1984. The centre provided a platform for researchers from many disciplines and stakeholders to conduct research and training in agricultural and development policies. PKDP was also involved in national and international seminars, conferences and workshops.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Institut Kajian Dasar Pertanian dan Makanan (IKDPM),[32] or Agricultural and Food Policy Studies Institute (AFPSI) was established in response to the increased government emphasis on agriculture in the Malaysian economy.\r\nInstitute for Social Science Studies\r\n\r\nInstitute for Social Science Studies (IPSAS)[33] was established as a center of excellence for research and development (R & D) in the field of social sciences. It examines and analyses current social questions and provides answers and solutions. Along with this focus study focuses on youth development issues of the country.\r\n\r\nThe journey from its early formation as an Institute Community and Peace Studies (PEKKA) in 2001 to its current name of Institute for Social Science Studies. A transition of change in the research focus towards Youth Development and efforts into making the institute as a regional centre of reference in this field.[citation needed]\r\nInstitute of Tropical Agriculture\r\n\r\nThe Institute of Tropical Agriculture (ITA)[34] was established on 1 January 2007 through merging of various institutes including the Institute of Plantation Studies. The establishment of this institute was the outcome of the restructuring and rationalisation process of institutes, academy, and centres in Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). This rationalisation process was implemented as a proactive and integrated effort taken to strengthen UPM status as a Research University (RU) and to become the center of excellence in agriculture education in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nIn line with UPM mission to have an efficient and effective administration structure via the lean and mean concept, the University has identified six new research clusters: Agriculture, Food, Forestry and Environment, Health, Social Science and Science, and Engineering and Technology to enhance research activities in UPM. In addition, UPM has identified eight specific research thrusts for each cluster, in line with the government\'s emphasis on the country\'s agriculture development agenda.\r\n\r\nThree of the eight identified thrusts — Food Crops, Plantation Crops and Animal Production — will be ITA\'s research focus.\r\nSchools\r\nSchool Of Graduate Studies\r\n\r\nThe School of Graduate Studies (SGS)[35] is a service and administrative centre established to assist postgraduate students in the processes involved from their registration at UPM up to the completion of their studies. SGS is the core support system which helps ease and enhance the postgraduate experience for UPM students, and plays a crucial role in fostering the relationship between UPM and its graduates.\r\n\r\nInitially set up as a Graduate Study Unit in 1978, SGS then proceeded to become a fully functioning Graduate School Office (GSO) in February 1993, to serve the growing population of postgraduate students at UPM. In March 2002, it continued to flourish as it was officially renamed the School of Graduate Studies (SGS) and was established as a service centre which had a status equivalent to a faculty at the university. This entailed its bigger role in the co-ordination of all postgraduate programmes and activities at UPM.\r\n\r\nIn its original inception, its key role also included an active involvement in research and development in postgraduate studies. In other words, SGS was conceptualised not only as a service centre to facilitate the general running of matters related to postgraduate students, but it was deemed to play a more active and crucial role in bolstering UPM\'s status as a research university.\r\n\r\nAmong its main roles as stated in the 1992 proposal for its establishment are:\r\n\r\n    To cultivate and nurture a research culture through efficient and effective management of postgraduate research activities\r\n    To help the university produce graduates who are knowledgeable and skilled to meet the nation\'s needs\r\n    To improve the quality of postgraduate programmes and therefore reduce the need for overseas postgraduate training\r\n    To increase the international student population and contribute to UPM\'s internationalisation through the intensification of publication and research training for staff.\r\n\r\nPutra Business School\r\n\r\nPutra Business School[36] – formerly the Graduate School of Management, in Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang.\r\n\r\nPUTRA became the first business programme in Malaysia to receive accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Other business programmes accredited by AACSB include Harvard, London Business School, Wharton, the University of Warwick and Yale. Only five percent of business programmes in the world enjoy AACSB accreditation.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nPUTRA has been set up by a not-for-profit foundation, YAYASAN PUTRA BUSINESS SCHOOL – as a private entity with public interest.\r\nCentres\r\nCentre for Diagnostic Nuclear Imaging\r\n\r\nThis small unit started as part of the Department of Imaging, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Universiti Putra Malaysia in 2003. Subsequently, the unit was restructured and repositioned as part of the Dean Office and known as Nuclear Imaging Unit.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2008, under the 9th Malaysian Plan, the Centre for Diagnostic Nuclear Imaging Project obtained its approval from the Malaysian Ministry Of Higher Education. The project started in the following year and took 11 months to complete and commissioned. On 1 April 2010, the centre started its operation and became the first PET CT equipment installed under the Ministry Of Higher Education for teaching, learning and research development by providing service to the public.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, during early phase of development, the unit contributed teaching activities in diagnostic imaging programs in other institutions leading to good academic and research networking.[citation needed] The research activities from the unit were partly supported by International partners through financial and non-financial assistance including Ospedale Niguarda, Milan, Italy, Oncology Research Foundation, Italy and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Austria. The unit also initiated research collaborations with other local institutions and hospitals.\r\n\r\nToday, the unit is ready to provide clinical services in PET/CT by expanding from oncology and introducing new clinical areas of PET/CT in infection, inflammation, cardiology and neurology. References have been received from public and private hospitals including university hospitals. In support of the government\'s aspiration and in line with the Strategic Plan of Malaysian Ministry Of Higher Education, the centre will spearhead the research and academic development in clinical integrated diagnostic imaging specialisation. From 1 October 2010, the unit is officially known as Centre For Diagnostic Nuclear Imaging (PPDN).[37]\r\nResearch Management Centre\r\n\r\nThe Research Management Centre (RMC)[38] was officially established in May 2000 to replace the former University Research Unit that was formed in 1992, to mobilise research management and enhance the overall impact of research to expand alliances and reinforce partnerships with other world class research universities.\r\nCancer Resource & Education Center\r\n\r\nIn year 2002, two cancer survivors, one from Malaysia and the other from USA, initiated the idea of adapting and translating selected educational materials into Malay language as one of the ways in providing the much needed information on breast cancer treatment in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nTheir effort evolved into major educational activity; Cancer Education and Research Project (CaEd). Leadership for this program is being provided cooperatively by Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and Cornell University. CaEd formally commenced its operation in Malaysia in September 2003.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, a center called Cancer Resource & Education Center (CaRE)[39] was set up to house the activities of cancer education, information and support programs.\r\n\r\nThis center was officially launched on 8 July 2009 by YB Senator Dato’ Sri Shahrizat Abdul Jalil, Minister of Women, Family and Community Development.\r\n\r\nIn August 2011, CaRE was institutionalised under UPM as a Center of Excellence.[citation needed]\r\nUniversity Community Transformation Centre\r\n\r\nIn the 90s, Professional Advancement Centre (PACE), Agro-Entrepreneur Development Centre (AgroPAC) and Agricultural Extension Institute (IPP) were setups. In January 2007, these 3 entities were rejuvenated as Centre for Extension, Entrepreneurship and Professional Advancement (APEEC).\r\n\r\nAs the role of APEEC met approval of criteria for establishment of UCTC by NBOS, APEEC was renamed as University Community Transformation Centre (UCTC)[40] UPM and its role realigned. This renaming effectively retained previous organisation albeit with some roles and directions adjustments commensurate with its new function as a more pivotal link to communities.\r\n\r\nThe rebranding was formally approved by Universiti Putra Malaysia\'s Senate 575th meeting and came in effect on 14 Mac 2013. Hence, UPM had a leap start a far as UCTC UPM was concerned');
